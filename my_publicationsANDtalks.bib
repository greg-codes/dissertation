	abstract={We present a study of the crystal structure and physical properties of single crystals of a new Fe-based ternary compound, Zr 2− x Fe 4 Si 16− y ( x = 0.81, y = 6.06). Zr 1.19 Fe 4 Si 9.94 is a layered compound, where stoichiometric β -FeSi 2 -derived slabs are separated by Zr-Si planes with substantial numbers of vacancies. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) experiments show that these Zr-Si layers consist of 3.5 nm domains where the Zr and Si vacancies are ordered within a supercell sixteen times the volume of the stoichiometric cell. Within these domains, the occupancies of the Zr and Si sites obey symmetry rules that permit only certain compositions, none of which by themselves reproduce the average composition found in x-ray diffraction experiments. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements reveal a small but appreciable number of magnetic moments that remain freely fluctuating to 1.8 K, while neutron diffraction confirms the absence of bulk magnetic order with a moment of 0.2 μ B or larger down to 1.5 K. Electrical resistivity measurements find that Zr 1.19 Fe 4 Si 9.94 is metallic, and the modest value of the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat γ = C / T suggests that quasi-particle masses are not particularly strongly enhanced. The onset of superconductivity at T c  ≃ 6 K results in a partial resistive transition and a small Meissner signal, although a bulk-like transition is found in the specific heat. Sharp peaks in the ac susceptibility signal the interplay of the normal skin depth and the London penetration depth, typical of a system in which nano-sized superconducting grains are separated by a non-superconducting host. Ultra low field differential magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal the presence of a surprisingly large number of trace magnetic and superconducting phases, suggesting that the Zr-Fe-Si ternary system could be a potentially rich source of new bulk superconductors.}

	abstract ={Widespread adoption of superconducting technologies awaits the discovery of new materials with enhanced properties, especially higher superconducting transition temperatures Tc. The unexpected discovery of high Tc superconductivity in cuprates suggests that the highest Tcs occur when pressure or doping transform the localized and moment-bearing electrons in antiferromagnetic insulators into itinerant carriers in a metal, where magnetism is preserved in the form of strong correlations. The absence of this transition in Fe-based superconductors may limit their Tcs, but even larger Tcs may be possible in their isostructural Mn analogs, which are antiferromagnetic insulators like the cuprates. It is generally believed that prohibitively large pressures would be required to suppress the effects of the strong Hund’s rule coupling in these Mn-based compounds, collapsing the insulating gap and enabling superconductivity. Indeed, no Mn-based compounds are known to be superconductors. The electronic structure calculations and X-ray diffraction measurements presented here challenge these long held beliefs, finding that only modest pressures are required to transform LaMnPO, isostructural to superconducting host LaFeAsO, from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a metallic antiferromagnet, where the Mn moment vanishes in a second pressure-driven transition. Proximity to these charge and moment delocalization transitions in LaMnPO results in a highly correlated metallic state, the familiar breeding ground of superconductivity.},

	abstract={We report the first comprehensive study of the high temperature form ( α -phase) of iron disilicide. Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity and resistivity were performed on well characterized single crystals. With a nominal iron d 6 configuration and a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure that strongly resembles that of LiFeAs, α -FeSi 2 is a potential candidate for unconventional superconductivity. Akin to LiFeAs, α -FeSi 2 does not develop any magnetic order and we confirm its metallic state down to the lowest temperatures ( T = 1.8 K). However, our experiments reveal that paramagnetism and electronic correlation effects in α -FeSi 2 are considerably weaker than in the pnictides. Band theory calculations yield small Sommerfeld coefficients of the electronic specific heat γ = C e / T that are in excellent agreement with experiment. Additionally, realistic many-body calculations further corroborate that quasi-particle mass enhancements are only modest in α -FeSi 2 . Remarkably, we find that the natural tendency to vacancy formation in the iron sublattice has little influence on the iron valence and the density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, Mn doping does not significantly change the electronic state of the Fe ion. This suggests that the iron valence is protected against hole doping and indeed the substitution of Co for Fe causes a rigid-band like response of the electronic properties. As a key difference from the pnictides, we identify the smaller inter-iron layer spacing, which causes the active orbitals near the Fermi level to be of a different symmetry in α -FeSi 2 . This change in orbital character might be responsible for the lack of superconductivity in this system, providing constraints on pairing theories in the iron based pnictides and chalcogenides.}

	abstract = {Abstract We explore the growth temperature dependence of GaAs/AlGaAs core/shell nanowires (NW) grown by metal–organic chemical-vapor deposition (MOCVD) on (1 0 0) and (1 1 1)B GaAs substrates. In-situ calibration of the growth temperature allows for a systematic variation with unprecedented resolution. Characterization by photoluminescence (PL) indicates that, at low growth temperatures, nanowires grown on (1 1 1)B substrates incorporate higher density of defects than wires on (1 0 0). On either substrate, nanowire core growth temperatures above 450 °C result in rising defect luminescence in the \{PL\} spectra concomitant with the increased epitaxial growth on the nanowire sidewalls at these higher temperatures. This work presents a systematic study of nanowire growth conditions that reveals the correlation between the growth temperature of the GaAs core, the chosen substrate surface orientation, and the resulting optical properties of GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires.}
