Lou DiMauro and Pierre Agostini - of course. say something up here about them and the group in general.

Thank you to the following people who have helped me throughout my scientific career:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Stephen Hageman - most work in this thesis was done in close collaboration with Steve. major components of beamline were designed solely by Steve, and he was there to help in nearly every single experiment. endless discussions on nearly every aspect of all experimental and design work.
	\item Andrew Piper for designing the OMRON vacuum control system, and attempting to implement interferometric stabilization on the TABLe.
	\item Dietrich Keissewetter for coding the Thorlabs/Newport motor interface and the homemade beamline pointing software. Also, thanks for helping with the initial design of the TABLe apparatus, helping to chase down vibrations and making subtle improvements to the apparatus.
	\item Kent Talbert for writing the entire LavVIEW software data collection suite.
	\item Antoine Camper for implementing the phase plate and phase gratings, as well as helping calibrate the photon spectrometer.
	\item Jakub Husek, Anthony Cirri, Somnath Biswas \& Prof. Robert Baker for many discussions pertaining to data collection, experimental design and sample considerations.
	\item Drake Austin and Enam Chowhury for helping me with the Keyldysh ionization calculations.
	\item Cristian Ott for designing the original ``cage and crank" vacuum flange manipulator, which we adapted to work with our photon spectrometer.
	\item Sierra O'Bryan for doing the initial optical design of the photon spectrometer.
	\item Yaguo Tang, Michael Chilcote, Michael Newburger, Jinson Xu \& Yutichai Mueanngern from OSU, Prof. S.K. Sundaram from Alfred University, Grant Johnson, Venkateshkumar (Venky) Prabhakaran, Le Wang \& Yingge Du from PNNL - for sample preparation.
	\item Eric Moore for automating the TABLe alignment system.
	\item Marieke Jager from the Leone group and Norman Niewrzella from the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology Business Group at Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, for answering my questions about ellipsoidal mirrors.
	\item Pete Gosser and Michael Graham at the Physics Machine Shop for machining countless parts (including our vacuum chambers) and providing endless consulting about general machining practices. Special thanks to Jon Shover from the Astronomy Machine Shop for welding our vacuum chambers and some components on the high pressure cell.
	\item Tim Gorman for endless discussions about physics, experimental design, laser troubleshooting, and good conversations.
	\item Rich Pfisterer, Ryan Irvin and Donna Pfisterer from Photon Engineering, for providing me a university gratis software license of FRED, and for teaching me to use the software efficiently.
	\item Phil Davids and Mark Reed for helping out with general building problems. Kent Ludwig for helping repair our rough vacuum system.
	\item Kris Dunlap, Mary Kay Jackson, Shirley McClung, Dameyon Shipley, Kyle Schechter and Jessica Middleton for help with administrative issues.
	\item Jack Simonson, Carlos Marques, Meigan Aronson \& Jacob Grosse from BNL for fostering my interest in science and encouraging me to go to graduate school. They set me down this path and I thank them for it.
	\item From my time in Dr. Yang's group: Nick Minutillo, Yi-Shin Chiu, Zeke, Prof. Yang.
	\item Everyone else in the DiMauro group who has helped me throughout the years: Stephen Schoun, Tim Scarborough, Cosmin Blaga, Hyunwook Park, Junliang Xu, Urszula Szafruga, Kaikai Zhang, Kevin Gudenkauf, Zhou Wang, Yu Hang (Marco) Lai, Bryan Smith, Sha (Lisa) Li, Abraham Camacho, Daniel Tuthill, Vyacheslav (Slava) Leshchenko, Li Fang.
