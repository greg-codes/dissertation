  abstract = {Combining results from several techniques of attosecond spectroscopy, we show that ionization gating of high-harmonic emission on the leading edge of the driving pulse produces isolated attosecond pulses with a contrast ratio (the energy in the main pulse normalized to the energy in adjacent satellite pulses) c {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3:3 \AE{} 0:2. Half-cycle cutoff analysis confirms that harmonic generation proceeds in the ionizationgated regime. The attosecond pulse contrast is measured using the technique of carrier\textendash envelope phase (CEP)-scanning, recently developed by our group, in which photoelectrons generated from Ne atoms by the harmonic pulse are streaked as a function of CEP. Streaking of photoelectrons as a function of attosecond time delay also confirms the isolated nature of the harmonic pulse, which is measured to have a duration of 430 \AE{} 15 as, limited by the bandwidth of the reflective X-ray optics employed. The combined measurements imply that the experimental advantages of the ionization gating technique\textemdash tunable X-ray emission, relaxed sensitivity to the CEP and scalability to longer driver pulses\textemdash are also conferred on isolated attosecond pulse production.},

  abstract = {The word `attosecond' (1 as = 10-18 s) officially entered the vocabulary of physics when sub-femtosecond pulses of UV/XUV light produced either by nonlinear frequency conversion of a ultra-short infrared pump pulse or Fourier synthesis of broad bandwidth radiation were established. The physics of these pulses is based on nonlinear, nonperturbative laser\textendash atom interaction: stimulated Raman scattering or high harmonic generation (HHG) is used to generate the necessary bandwidth, which naturally encompasses the visible and UV/XUV spectral range. However, the crucial element for attosecond pulse generation is the control of the spectral phase. New methods of temporal characterization at frequencies lying in the UV/XUV had to be elaborated. These methods rely on the energy/momentum analysis of photoelectrons produced by XUV attosecond flashes in the presence of an intense infrared field whose optical cycle itself becomes the basic clock. Single 650 as pulses have been produced and applied to trace the dynamics of electrons inside atoms following the creation of an inner-shell hole. Periodic combs of 250 as pulses have been synthesized by superposing just four harmonics and applying to the attosecond timing of the electron motion in HHG. Although it is easy to increase the bandwidth by coupling more harmonics, a fundamental limit to the duration of the light bursts produced has been discovered. It is imposed by the lack of synchronization of the different harmonic orders. The current limit is estimated to be 130 as. The latest advances include a direct autocorrelation of an attosecond pulse train and the production of a single 250 as soft x-ray pulse. This paper offers a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in the production and characterization of attosecond light pulses, with a glimpse at the first steps in attophysics.},

A complex representation: X(z) = {$\xi$}(z) + j{$\eta$}(z), where {$\xi$}(z) and {$\eta$}(z) are the projections of the skew ray on two perpendicular meridional planes, is discussed. It is found that the beam radius is equal to the modulus of X(z) and the on-axis phase to the phase of X(z). Using this representation, we derive a general expression for the on-axis phase shift {$\Delta\Phi$} experienced by a beam with an input complex beam parameter q through an optical system whose ray matrix is [ABCD]:{$\Delta\Phi$}=phase of(A+B/q). When the beam is matched to the optical system (output q = q), {$\Delta\Phi$} can be written cos\textendash 1(A + D)/2. This representation also provides a useful beam tracing method which is demonstrated and a simple interpretation for the known representation of Gaussian modes by ray packets.},

Photodissociation of CH2IBr along both the C\textendash I or C\textendash Br reaction coordinates is observed in real-time following excitation at 266 nm. At this wavelength, C\textendash I dissociation is the dominant reaction channel and C\textendash Br dissociation is observed as a minor pathway. Both photodissociation pathways are probed simultaneously through individual 4d(I) N4/5 and 3d(Br) M4/5 core-to-valence transitions. The 3d(Br) M4/5 pre-edge absorption spectrum of the CH2Br radical photoproduct corresponding to the C\textendash I dissociation channel is characterized for the first time. Although the radical's singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is mostly localized on the central carbon atom, the 3d(Br)\textrightarrow{$\pi$} {${_\ast}$}(SOMO) resonances at 68.5 eV and 69.5 eV are detected 2 eV below the parent molecule 3d(Br)\textrightarrow{$\sigma$} {${_\ast}$}(LUMO) transitions. Core-to-valence XUV absorption spectroscopy provides a unique probe of the local electronic structure of the radical species in reference to the Br reporter atom. The measured times for C\textendash I dissociation leading to I and I{${_\ast}$} atomic products are 48 {$\pm$} 12 fs and 44 {$\pm$} 4 fs, respectively, while the measured C\textendash Br dissociation time leading to atomic Br is 114 {$\pm$} 17 fs. The investigation performed here demonstrates the capability of femtosecond time-resolved core-level spectroscopy utilizing multiple reporter atoms simultaneously.},

In this work, we systematically study single-shot, fs-laser ablation (fs-LIA) of single-crystal germanium from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, and compare the fs-LIA wavelength scaling with two widely used models. We show that these models are inadequate, particularly at mid-infrared wavelengths. Instead, a hybrid model is proposed involving Keldysh ionization rates, a constant free-carrier density threshold, and multi-band effects, which yields good agreement with experimental observations. Aspects of this model may be applied to understanding other strong-field non-perturbative phenomena in solids.},

They investigate the influence of the laser pulse width, the excitation wavelength (from the near infrared to the ultraviolet) and the atomic medium on the number of photons produced and on the maximum energy attained. Harmonic generation also depends strongly on the focusing conditions. By using simple arguments and results of numerical calculations in xenon, they show that the conversion efficiency in general follows a simple b3 power law, b denoting the laser confocal parameter, up to a transition regime where the coherence length of the process becomes equal to the medium length. By applying the b3 scaling as a normalization factor, they can then compare experimental results obtained in different focusing geometries. Their experimental data show that the optimization of the photon energy produced is favoured by using long incident wavelengths and light atomic systems with a high ionization energy.},

Using multiphoton transitions, we populate a superposition of quantum states which coherently emit extreme ultraviolet radiation through free induction decay. This emission is probed and controlled, both in amplitude and phase, by a time-delayed infrared femtosecond pulse. We directly measure the laser-induced dephasing of the emission by using a simple heterodyne detection scheme based on two-source interferometry. This technique provides rich information about the interplay between the laser field and the Coulombic potential on the excited electron dynamics. Its background-free nature enables us to use a large range of gas pressures and to reveal the influence of collisions in the relaxation process.},

Individual quantum beats of the wavepacket are detected by perturbing the induced polarization of the medium with a time-delayed few-femtosecond near-infrared (NIR) pulse via coupling the individual states to multiple neighboring levels. All of the initially excited states are monitored simultaneously in the attosecond transient absorption spectrum, revealing Lorentzian to Fano lineshape spectral changes as well as quantum beats. The most prominent beating of the several that were observed was in the spin\textendash orbit split 3d absorption features, which has a 40 femtosecond period that corresponds to the spin\textendash orbit splitting of 0.1 eV. The few-level models and multilevel calculations confirm that the observed magnitude of oscillation depends strongly on the spectral bandwidth and tuning of the NIR pulse and on the location of possible coupling states.},

Novel transient absorption experiments in gases using isolated attosecond pulses are performed in two regimes, one in which the attosecond pulse is overlapped in time with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse and one in which the NIR pulse follows the attosecond pulse. In the latter regime, the attosecond pulse first interacts with a sample, then the observed absorption features are modified by a NIR pulse, which interacts with the sample well after the attosecond pulse has passed. In these experiments, which seem counterintuitive when compared to conventional transient absorption spectroscopy, the weak attosecond pulse induces a polarization of the medium, which is then perturbed by the time-delayed NIR pulse. Recent measurements demonstrate the rich variety of information that can be extracted in this regime.},

Core-level X-ray spectroscopy at the carbon-1s K-edge (284 eV) is applied to identify the role of the triplet state (T1, 3{$\pi\pi$}*) in the ultraviolet-induced photochemistry of pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone, AcAc). The excited-state dynamics initiated at 266 nm (1{$\pi\pi$}*, S2) is investigated with element- and sitespecificity using broadband soft X-ray pulses produced by high harmonic generation, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations of the X-ray spectra for the excited electronic singlet and triplet states. The evolution of the core-to-valence resonances at the carbon K-edge establishes an ultrafast population of the T1 state (3{$\pi\pi$}*) in AcAc via intersystem crossing on a 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 ps time scale.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {The creation of attosecond pulses using high harmonic generation (HHG) to produce extreme ultraviolet light (XUV) pulses has enabled table-top core-level spectroscopy in both the gas and solid phase. Because HHG relies on a near infrared (NIR) driver pulse to create the XUV radiation, it is readily incorporated into pump-probe transient absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, giving way to measurements with unprecedented temporal resolution. The ability of attosecond XUV pump-probe spectroscopy to study solid state semiconductor materials allows for the interrogation of carriers on the timescales where a separation between electronic and lattice dynamics can occur. This will have far reaching implications addressing the fundamental carrier physics that govern the next generation of hot carrier charge transfer devices, which are at the forefront of photocatalytic and electronic device development. In this dissertation, a literature review of XUV transient absorption on solids using HHG is presented in Chapter 1. This chapter details the progress from femtosecond experiments on metal-oxide thin  lms to attosecond time-resolved experiments on semiconductors. In Chapter 2, the design and construction of the attosecond transient absorption apparatus capable of studying ultrafast dynamics in both solid state and gas phase samples using a near infrared (NIR) pump and an extreme ultraviolet (XUV) probe is presented. Chapter 3 presents transient absorption experiments done on germanium thin  lms, which measure both electrons and hole dynamics simultaneously in a single measurement. These results are supported by work from a theory collaboration. in Chapter 4, preliminary work on silicon germanium alloys is presented. While the results need further con rmation by additional experiments and characterization, it is clear that signals from hot carrier relaxation are present. Chapter 5 presents a theoretical investigation of a future experiment on silver nanoparticles using a velocity map imaging (VMI) device. The key feature of this theoretical study is the identi cation of a metric to follow the near- eld of the plasmon, isolated from the electric  eld of the exciting laser pulse.},

The analysis is treated in many textbooks, and implemented in many software programs, but certain aspects of it are difficult to find explicitly and consistently worked out in the literature. Here, we derive the formulas underlying the transfer-matrix method of calculating the optical properties of these stacks, including oblique-angle incidence, absorption-vs-position profiles, and ellipsometry parameters. We discuss and explain some strange consequences of the formulas in the situation where the incident and/or final (semi-infinite) medium are absorptive, such as calculating \$T{$>$}1\$ in the absence of gain. We also discuss some implementation details like complex-plane branch cuts. Finally, we derive modified formulas for including one or more "incoherent" layers, i.e. very thick layers in which interference can be neglected. This document was written in conjunction with the "tmm" Python software package, which implements these calculations.},

We used a 0-\textbackslash (\textbackslash pi\textbackslash ) phase plate to create two bright spots at the focus of a lens by converting a Gaussian laser beam into a TEM please define \textbackslash (\_\{01\}\textbackslash ) Transverse Electromagnetic Mode. The two bright foci produce two synchronized HHG sources. One of them is used to probe on-going dynamics in the generating medium, while the other serves to heterodyne the signal. The interference of the emissions in the far\textendash field gives access to the phase difference between the two sources. In self\textendash probing HHG phase spectroscopy, one of the two sources is used as a reference while the other one probes some on goin dynamics in the generating medium.  We first compute overlap integrals to investigate the mode conversion efficiency. We then establish a clear relation between the laser phase-front curvature and the far-field overlap of the two HHG beams. Both Fresnel diffraction calculations and an experimental lens position scan are used to reveal variations of the phase front inclination in each source. We show that this arrangement offers \textbackslash (\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash lambda\_\{XUV\}\}\{100\}\textbackslash ) precision, enabling extremely sensitive phase measurements. Finally, we use this compact setup for TSI and measure phase variations across the molecular alignment revival of nitrogen and in vibrating sulfur hexafluoride. In both gases, the phase variations change sign around the ionization threshold of the investigated molecule.},

We use a close-coupling ansatz constructed on a multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock description of localized states and B-spline expansions of the electron radial wave functions. In this implementation, the general many-electron problem can be tackled thanks to the use of the atsp2k libraries [C. Froese Fischer et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 176, 559 (2007)]. In the present contribution, we combine this method with exterior complex scaling, thereby allowing for the computation of the complex partial amplitudes that encode the whole dynamics of the photoionization process. The method is validated on the 3s3p6np series of resonances converging to the 3s extraction. Then, it is used for computing the energy dependent differential atomic delay between 3p and 3s photoemission, and agreement is found with the measurements of Gu\'enot et al. [Phys. Rev. A 85, 053424 (2012)]. The effect of the presence of resonances in the one-photon spectrum on photoionization delay measurements is studied.},

Our experimental approach is based on extreme ultraviolet interferometry with isolated attosecond pulses and on the demonstration that the motion of an attosecond electron wave packet is sensitive to perturbing fields only along the direction of its motion. By exploiting the sensitivity of interferometric techniques and by controlling the emission and acceleration direction of the wave packet, pulses with energies as low as a few hundreds of nanojoules can be reconstructed. Our approach reveals the possibility to characterize completely the electric field of the pulses typically used in visible pump\textendash probe spectroscopy.},

Employing transitions in the vicinity of the iron 3p (M2,3) edge, the dissociation is monitored from the point of view of the iron atom. With low strong field pump intensities ({$\approx$}2 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm-2), only ferrocenium cations are produced, and their iron 3p absorption spectrum is reported. It very closely resembles the 3p spectrum of atomic Fe+ ions but is red-shifted by 0.8 eV. With the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the spectrum is assigned to a combination of doublet and quartet spin states of ferrocenium ions. Ionization with more intense strong field pump pulses ({$\geq$}6 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm-2) leads predominantly to the prompt production of ferrocenium ions that dissociate to give the spectral signature of bare Fe+ ions within 240 {$\pm$} 80 fs. Within the temporal resolution of the experiment ({$\approx$}40 fs), no spectral intermediates are observed, suggesting that the dissociation process occurs directly from the excited ferrocenium ion and that the bonds between the iron center and both cyclopentadienyl rings are broken almost simultaneously in an asynchronous concerted decay process. No evidence of slower dissociation channels is observed at a pump-probe delay of 250 ps, suggesting that all energy is very rapidly routed into dissociative states.},

  address = {{Orlando, FL}},
  abstract = {One of the most fundamental goals of attosecond science is to observe and to control the dynamic evolutions of electrons in matter. The attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is a powerful tool to utilize attosecond pulse to measure electron dynamics in quantum systems directly. In this work, isolated single attosecond pulses are used to probe electron dynamics in atoms and to study dynamics in hydrogen molecules using the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy technique. The target atom/molecule is first pumped to excited states and then probed by a subsequent attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse or by a near infrared (NIR) laser pulse. By measuring the absorbed attosecond XUV pulse spectrum, the ultrafast electron correlation dynamics can be studied in real time. The quantum processes that can be studied using the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy include the AC stark shift, multi-photon absorption, intermediate states of atoms, autoionizing states, and transitions of vibrational states in molecules. In all experiments, the absorption changes as a function of the time delay between the attosecond XUV probe pulse and the dressing NIR laser pulse, on a time scale of sub-cycle laser period, which reveals attosecond electron dynamics. These experiments demonstrate that the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy can be performed to study and control electronic and nuclear dynamics in quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution, and it opens door for the study of electron dynamics in large molecules and other more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Tracking and controlling the dynamic evolution of matter under the influence of external fields is among the most fundamental goals of physics. In the microcosm, the motion of electrons follows the laws of quantum mechanics and evolves on the timescale set by the atomic unit of time, 24 attoseconds. While only a few time-dependent quantum mechanical systems can be solved theoretically, recent advances in the generation, characterization, and application of isolated attosecond pulses and few-cycle femtosecond lasers have given experimentalists the necessary tools for dynamic measurements on these systems. However, pioneering studies in attosecond science have so far been limited to the measurement of free electron dynamics, which can in most cases be described approximately using classical mechanics. Novel tools and techniques for studying bound states of matter are therefore desired to test the available theoretical models and to enrich our understanding of the quantum world on as-yet unprecedented timescales. In this work, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with ultrabroadband attosecond pulses is presented as a technique for direct measurement of electron dynamics in quantum systems, demonstrating for the first time that the attosecond transient absorption technique allows for state-resolved and simultaneous measurement of bound and continuum state dynamics. The helium atom is the primary target of the presented studies, owing to its accessibility to theoretical modeling with both ab initio simulations and to model systems with reduced dimensionality. In these studies, ultrafast dynamics \textendash{} on timescales shorter than the laser cycle \textendash{} are observed in prototypical quantum mechanical processes such as the AC Stark and ponderomotive energy level shifts, Rabi oscillations and electromagnetically-induced absorption and transparency, and two-color multi-photon absorption to ``dark'' states of the atom. These features are observed in both bound states and quasi-bound autoionizing states of the atom. Furthermore, dynamic interference oscillations, corresponding to quantum path interferences involving bound and free electronic states of the atom, are observed for the first time in an optical measurement. These first experiments demonstrate the applicability of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with ultrabroadband attosecond pulses to the study and control of electron dynamics in quantum mechanical systems with high fidelity and state selectivity. The technique is therefore ideally suited for the study of charge transfer and collective electron motion in more complex systems. The transient absorption studies on atomic bound states require ultrabroadband attosecond pulses - attosecond pulses with large spectral bandwidth compared to their central frequency. This is due to the fact that the bound states in which we are interested lie only 15-25 eV above the ground state, so the central frequency of the pulse should lie in this range. On the other hand, the bandwidth needed to generate an isolated 100 as pulse exceeds 18 eV \textendash{} comparable to or even larger than the central frequency. However, current methods for characterizing attosecond pulses require that the attosecond pulse spectrum bandwidth is small compared to its central frequency, known as the central momentum approximation. We therefore explore the limits of attosecond pulse characterization using the current technology and propose a novel method for characterizing ultrabroadband attosecond pules, which we term PROOF (phase retrieval by omega oscillation filtering). We demonstrate the PROOF technique with both simulated and experimental data, culminating in the characterization of a world-record-breaking 67 as pulse.},

  abstract = {One of the research goals in the DiMauro group is the application of attosecond light pulses for understanding electronic processes and for molecular imaging. The objective of this dissertation work was the construction of an attosecond beamline at The Ohio State University, and the implementation of the so-called Rabbitt technique. This apparatus is the second of its kind in the United States. The Rabbitt experiment is a pump-probe interferometer that leads to the characterization of the temporal structure of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) and soft X ray harmonics, generated using intense IR (infrared) lasers. This allows us to find the optimal conditions for generating attosecond pulses. The attosecond pulses can then be used in the same apparatus to study the dynamics of atomic processes on the attosecond timescale and for molecular imaging. The novelty of this setup is the use of long wavelength ({$>$} 1{$\mu$}m) laser beams, which will generate much shorter attosecond pulses than reported so far in literature and with a central energy that can be chosen to be much higher. One of the results of the experiment is the determination of the attochirp (i.e. the second order derivative of the harmonics' phase with respect to their frequency) scaling with the fundamental laser wavelength. The attochirp is found to have a dependence on the atomic species used to generate the harmonics. The attochirp also significantly depends on the position of the generating gas source relative to the laser focus, the pressure of the generating gas and the IR laser intensity. The influence of inner subshell electrons and the fine structure of the detection gas, secondary electrons, as well as Fano resonances in the detection gas are discussed.},

Because RA spectra probe both the real (i.e., reflection) and the imaginary (i.e., attenuation) parts of the refractive index, a general method is required to analyze RA spectra.

We find that the imaginary part of the refractive index reports on the chemical state of the metal center, while the real part is additionally sensitive to the surface morphology of the material.},

  address = {{Orlando, FL}},
  abstract = {Attosecond pulses have been developed as a means for investigating phenomena that proceed on the order of the atomic unit of time (24 as). Unfortunately, these extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses by themselves contain too few photons to initiate nonlinear dynamics or dress states in an attosecond pump\textendash attosecond probe scheme. As a result, most attosecond experiments thus far have featured complementary near infrared (NIR) femtosecond lasers for instigating electron dynamics. In order to access the benefits of all-attosecond measurements and open attosecond physics to new fields of exploration, the photon flux of these pulses must be increased. One way to boost the attosecond pulse energy is to scale up the energy of the NIR pulse responsible for driving high-harmonic generation (HHG). With generalized double optical gating (GDOG), isolated attosecond pulses can be generated with multi-cycle laser systems, wherein the pulse energy can be boosted more easily than in the few-cycle laser systems required by other gating methods. At the Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (IFAST), this scalability was demonstrated using a 350 mJ, 15 fs (10 TW) Ti:sapphire laser, which was used to generate a 100 nJ XUV continuum. This represented an order-of-magnitude improvement over typical attosecond pulse energies achievable by millijoule-level few-cycle lasers. To obtain the microjoule-level attosecond pulse energy required for performing all-attosecond experiments, the attosecond flux generated by the IFAST 10 TW system was still deficient by an order of magnitude. To this end, the laser system was upgraded to provide joule-level output energies while maintaining pulse compression to 15 fs, with a targeted peak power of 200 TW. This was accomplished by adding an additional Ti:sapphire amplifier to the existing 10 TW system and implementing a new pulse compression system to accommodate the higher pulse energy. Because this system operated at a 10 Hz repetition rate, stabilization of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) \textendash{} important for controlling attosecond pulse production \textendash{} could not be achieved using traditional methods. Therefore, a new scheme was developed, demonstrating the first-ever control of CEP in a chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA) at low repetition rates. Finally, a new variation of optical gating was proposed as a way to improve the efficiency of the attosecond pulse generation process. This method was also predicted to allow for the generation of isolated attosecond pulses with longer driving laser pulses, as well as the extension of the highenergy photon cut-off of the XUV continuum.},

The measured changes in the XUV transition probability do not energetically agree with the increasing electron photoexcitation energy. The data experimentally confirm that, for the Si L2,3 edge, the time-dependent electron and hole energies are partially obscured by the core-hole perturbation. A model based on many-body approximations and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is successfully used to predict the core-hole modification of the final transition density of states in terms of both electronic and structural dynamics. The resulting fit time constants match the excited-state electron thermalization time and the intervalley electron-phonon, intravalley electron-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering times previously measured in silicon. The outlined approach is a more comprehensive framework for interpreting transient XUV absorption spectra in photoexcited semiconductors.},

  abstract = {The development of intense, ultrashort, table-top lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectral region, offers many new avenues for strong-field physics. Atoms submitted to such radiation allow photoelectrons to acquire huge quiver energies well over an order of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the neutral. Consequently, many interesting phenomena arise. First, wavelength offers a convenient experimental knob to tune the ionization regime by controlling the Keldysh parameter. Second, high harmonic generation depends directly on the quiver energy and can, therefore, be pushed to unprecedented limits. Third, wavelength controls the spectral phase of harmonics, and hence the possibility to improve the generation of pulses in the attosecond regime. The use of long wavelength lasers is critical to studying high-order harmonic generation in condensed phase systems, because they facilitate harmonic generation within the transmission window of the material and increase the damage threshold. We review some of the recent discoveries in long wavelength driven high-order harmonic generation in the case of isolated atoms, bulk crystals, and liquid.},

In this work, we explore and develop theoretical tools needed for interpretation of such spectra,in order to characterize the vibrational coherences that result from ionizing a molecule in a strong IR field. Ab initio data for F2 is combined with simulations of nuclear dynamics, in order to simulate time-resolved X-ray absorption spectra for vibrational wavepackets after coherent ionization at 0 K and at finite temperature. Dihalogens pose rather difficult electronic structure problems, and the issues encountered in this work will be reflective of those encountered with any core\textendash valence excitation simulation when a bond is breaking. The simulations reveal a strong dependence of the X-ray absorption maximum on the locations of the vibrational wave packets. A Fourier transform of the simulated signal shows features at the overtone frequencies of both the neutral and the cation, which reflect spatial interferences of the vibrational eigenstates. This provides a direct path for implementing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopic methods to visualize coherent nuclear dynamics.},

  abstract = {Low-dimensional nanomaterials have been explored extensively in the last decades, partly fuelled by the new possibilities for tuning and controlling their electronic properties. In a broader perspective within catalysis, two-, one- and zero-dimensional (2D, 1D and 0D) inorganic nanomaterials represent a bridge between the selectivity of molecular catalysts and the high performance and stability of inorganic catalysts. As a consequence of the low dimensions, higher surface areas are obtained but also introduce new physics and increased tuneability of the electronic states in the nanostructured system. Herein, we derive the commonly used equations for optical transitions and carrier confinement in semiconductors and discuss their effect on the optical and photocatalytic properties of direct band and indirect band gap materials. In particular, the physical properties of the optical and photocatalytic properties of Fe               2               O               3               and ZnO will be used to exemplify the effects of the low dimensionality.

  abstract = {Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) using femtosecond extreme ultraviolet high harmonics has recently emerged as a powerful tool for investigating ultrafast quasiparticle dynamics in correlated-electron materials. However, the full potential of this approach has not yet been achieved because, to date, high harmonics generated by 800nm wavelength Ti:Sapphire lasers required a trade-off between photon flux, energy and time resolution. Photoemission spectroscopy requires a quasi-monochromatic output, but dispersive optical elements that select a single harmonic can significantly reduce the photon flux and time resolution. Here we show that 400nm driven high harmonic extreme-ultraviolet trARPES is superior to using 800nm laser drivers since it eliminates the need for any spectral selection, thereby increasing photon flux and energy resolution to {$<$}150meV while preserving excellent time resolution of about 30fs.},

Their relative contribution can be strongly influenced by the presence of resonances, whose assignment remains a major challenge for high-harmonic spectroscopy. Here we present a multi-modal approach for the investigation of unaligned polyatomic molecules, using SF6 as an example. We combine methods from extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy, above-threshold ionization and attosecond metrology. Fragment-resolved above-threshold ionization measurements reveal that strong-field ionization opens at least three channels. A shape resonance in one of them is found to dominate the signal in the 20\textendash 26 eV range. This resonance induces a phase jump in the harmonic emission, a switch in the polarization state and different dynamical responses to molecular vibrations. This study demonstrates a method for extending high-harmonic spectroscopy to polyatomic molecules, where complex attosecond dynamics are expected.},

  abstract = {A single equation for gas flow through capillaries, applicable to the flow regimes extending from molecular to viscous flow, is derived by formulating corrections to the Poiseuille equation for viscous flow. These correction terms are necessary to allow for transmission to the tube wall of the momentum generated by the pressure gradient. It is shown that the equation agrees closely with experimental observation, reducing to Knudsen's equation for molecular flow as the pressure tends to zero. In the appendix an argument is put forward to explain the variation among experimental measurements of the slip coefficient.},

Its exceptional properties, such as coherence and (sub)-femtosecond pulse durations, have led to a diversity of applications1. Some of these require a high photon flux and megahertz repetition rates, for example, to avoid space charge effects in photoelectron spectroscopy2,3,4. To date, this has only been achieved with enhancement cavities5. Here, we establish a novel route towards powerful HHG sources. By achieving phase-matched HHG of a megahertz fibre laser we generate a broad plateau (25 eV\textendash 40 eV) of strong harmonics, each containing more than 1 \texttimes{} 1012 photons s\textendash 1, which constitutes an increase by more than one order of magnitude in that wavelength range6,7,8. The strongest harmonic (H25, 30 eV) has an average power of 143 {$\mu$}W (3 \texttimes{} 1013 photons s\textendash 1). This concept will greatly advance and facilitate applications in photoelectron or coincidence spectroscopy9, coherent diffractive imaging10 or (multidimensional) surface science2.},

  abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

  abstract = {The identities of photoexcited states in thin-film Co3O4 and the ultrafast carrier relaxation dynamics of Co3O4 are investigated with oxidation-state-specific pump-probe femtosecond core level spectroscopy. A thin-film sample is excited near the 2.8 eV optical absorption peak, and the resulting spectral changes at the 58.9 eV M2,3edge of cobalt are probed in transient absorption with femtosecond highorder harmonic pulses generated by a Ti/sapphire laser. The initial transient state shows a significant 2 eV redshift in the absorption edge compared to the static ground state, which indicates a reduction of the cobalt valence charge. This is confirmed by a charge transfer multiplet spectral simulation, which finds the experimentally observed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectrum matches the specific O2-(2p) \textrightarrow{} Co3+(eg) charge-transfer transition, out of six possible excitation pathways involving Co3+ and Co2+ in the mixed-valence material. The initial transient state has a power-dependent amplitude decay (190 {$\pm$} 10 fs at 13.2 mJ/cm2) together with a slight redshift in spectral shape (535 {$\pm$} 33 fs), which are ascribed to hot carrier relaxation to the band edge. The faster amplitude decay is possibly due to a decrease of charge carrier density via an Auger mechanism, as the decay rate increases when more excitation fluence is used. This study takes advantage of the oxidation-state-specificity of time-resolved XUV spectroscopy, further establishing the method as a new approach to measure ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in condensed-phase systems.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {With the ability to disentangle electronic transitions that occur on different elements and local electronic structures, time-resolved extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying ultrafast dynamics in condensed phase systems. In this dissertation, a visible-pump/XUV-probe transient absorption apparatus with femtosecond resolution was constructed to investigate the carrier relaxation dynamics in semiconductors after photo-excitation. This includes timescales for carrier thermalization by carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering. The 30 \textendash{} 72 eV photon energy coverage (17 \textendash{} 40 nm wavelength) generated by a table-top XUV light source is suitable for probing the 3p-to-3d core level absorptions of various transition metal oxides (TMOs) with specificities to elements and oxidation states. In Chapter 1, a brief introduction to charge carrier dynamics in semiconductor-based materials is given. In addition, fundamentals of core-level spectroscopy and the high harmonic generation (HHG) process are also addressed in this introductory chapter. Specifications of the experimental apparatus that was constructed are summarized in Chapter 2, including the design concepts and characterization of performance. Chapter 3 presents the spectral tunability of the XUV pulses generated from a semi-infinite gas cell (SIGC), as well as the data acquisition procedures. Charge carrier relaxation dynamics in Co3O4 following the charge transfer excitation pathway at 400 nm are documented in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, various visible pump wavelengths are used to excite Co3O4 and the differences in the carrier dynamics versus excitation wavelength are considered. After selectively photoexciting a Si/TiO2 heterojunction, the resulted electron transfer process is observed and reported in Chapter 6. The concluding remarks of the dissertation are made in Chapter 7, while several ongoing time-resolved experiments are addressed in the Appendix sections.},

Here, the experimentally observed curtailment of harmonic production on the leading edge of the driver pulse is shown to be controlled by an ionization-induced phase-matching condition. The transient plasma density inherent to the process of highharmonic generation terminates the harmonic emission by an ultrafast loss of phase matching on the leading edge of the laser pulse. The analysis is supported by a reconstruction of the in situ intensity envelope of the driver pulse with attosecond temporal resolution, performed by measurements of the carrier-envelope phase dependence of individual half-cycle harmonic cutoffs. The method opens the way to wavelengthtunable isolated attosecond pulse generation.},

This analysis is generalized to other advanced phase-matching schemes, thereby predicting the possibility to boost the conversion efficiencies using light noble gases.},

We show that the physical interpretation can be comprehensively done in the frame of classical theory of high-order harmonic generation without referring to a parametric effect in the XUV domain. The experimental conditions explored by Seres et al. indeed correspond to the case of long-pulse, low-infrared-energy laser beams for which tight focusing is necessary to reach the minimum intensity required for high atomic response. The positive atomic dispersion can compensate for the Gouy phase and explains the behavior of the experimental variation of the harmonic signal presented. We will show that our interpretation explains not only the global behavior of the curves but also the second-order variation of the signal as a function of experimental parameters.},

In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of mag-nitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave. It is shown that for optical frequencies the mechanism under consideration, of direct ioniza-tion by the wave field, may be significant in the case of electric breakdown in gases, and es-pecially in condensed media.},

Among the latter, the vacuum system is often a major contributor to the operating performance of a particle accelerator. The vacuum engineer has nowadays a large choice of computational schemes and tools for the correct analysis, design, and engineering of the vacuum system. This paper is a review of the different type of algorithms and methodologies which have been developed and employed in the field since the birth of vacuum technology. The different level of detail between simple back-of-the-envelope calculations and more complex numerical analysis is discussed by means of comparisons.

  abstract = {Extremely broad bandwidth attosecond pulses (which can support 16as pulses) have been demonstrated in our lab based on spectral measurements, however, compensation of intrinsic chirp and their characterization has been a major bottleneck. In this work, we developed an attosecond streak camera using a multi-layer Mo/Si mirror (bandwidth can support \textasciitilde 100as pulses) and position sensitive time-of-flight detector, and the shortest measured pulse was 107.5as using DOG, which is close to the mirror bandwidth. We also developed a PCGPA based FROG-CRAB algorithm to characterize such short pulses, however, it uses the central momentum approximation and cannot be used for ultra-broad bandwidth pulses. To facilitate the characterization of such pulses, we developed PROOF using Fourier filtering and an evolutionary algorithm. We have demonstrated the characterization of pulses with a bandwidth corresponding to \textasciitilde 20as using synthetic data. We also for the first time demonstrated single attosecond pulses (SAP) generated using GDOG with a narrow gate width from a multi-cycle driving laser without CE-phase lock, which opens the possibility of scaling attosecond photon flux by extending the technique to peta-watt class lasers. Further, we generated intense attosecond pulse trains (APT) from laser ablated carbon plasmas and demonstrated \textasciitilde 9.5 times more intense pulses as compared to those from argon gas and for the first time demonstrated a broad continuum from a carbon plasma using DOG. Additionally, we demonstrated \textasciitilde 100 times enhancement in APT from gases by switching to 400 nm (blue) driving pulses instead of 800 nm (red) pulses. We measured the ellipticity dependence of high harmonics from blue pulses in argon, neon and helium, and developed a simple theoretical model to numerically calculate the ellipticity dependence with good agreement with experiments. Based on the ellipticity dependence, we proposed a new scheme of blue GDOG which we predict can be employed to extract intense SAP from an APT driven by blue laser pulses. We also demonstrated compression of long blue pulses into {$>$}240 \textmu J broad bandwidth pulses using neon filled hollow core fiber, which is the highest reported pulse energy of short blue pulses. However, compression of phase using chirp mirrors is still a technical challenge.},

  abstract = {Electronic movement flashing into view Numerous chemical processes begin with ionization: the ejection of an electron from a molecule. What happens in the immediate aftermath of that event? Kraus et al. explored this question in iodoacetylene by detecting and analyzing the spectrum of emitted high harmonics (see the Perspective by Ueda). They traced the migration of the residual positively charged hole along the molecular axis on a time scale faster than a quadrillionth of a second. They thereby characterized the capacity of a laser field to steer the hole's motion in appropriately oriented molecules. Science, this issue p. 790; see also p. 740 The ultrafast motion of electrons and holes after light-matter interaction is fundamental to a broad range of chemical and biophysical processes. We advanced high-harmonic spectroscopy to resolve spatially and temporally the migration of an electron hole immediately after ionization of iodoacetylene while simultaneously demonstrating extensive control over the process. A multidimensional approach, based on the measurement and accurate theoretical description of both even and odd harmonic orders, enabled us to reconstruct both quantum amplitudes and phases of the electronic states with a resolution of \textasciitilde 100 attoseconds. We separately reconstructed quasi\textendash field-free and laser-controlled charge migration as a function of the spatial orientation of the molecule and determined the shape of the hole created by ionization. Our technique opens the prospect of laser control over electronic primary processes. High harmonics reveal fine details of electronic rearrangement in a molecule in the first instants after ionization. [Also see Perspective by Ueda] High harmonics reveal fine details of electronic rearrangement in a molecule in the first instants after ionization. [Also see Perspective by Ueda]},

In this Perspective, we discuss some of the major achievements in the study of nuclear and electronic dynamics with X-ray pulses produced by high-harmonic, free-electron-laser and synchrotron sources. The particular dynamic processes probed by X-ray radiation highlighted in this Perspective are electronic coherences on attosecond to femtosecond timescales, chemical reactions, such as dissociations, and pericyclic ring-openings, spincrossover dynamics, ligand-exchange dynamics and structural deformations in excited states. X-ray spectroscopic probing of chemical dynamics holds great promise for the future owing to the ongoing developments of new spectroscopies, such as four-wave mixing, and the continuous improvements in emerging laboratory-based, high-harmonic sources and large-scale, facility-based, free-electron lasers.},

A 48, R3433 (1993)] allows us to study the phase of the induced atomic dipole moment. We show that this phase exhibits a piecewise-linear dependence on the laser intensity. This dependence can be interpreted in quasiclassical terms, and is related to the action acquired by the electron during its motion in the laser field. The value of the phase, however, is also affected by the quantum effects of tunneling, diffusion, and interference. The phase of the dipole moment considerably influences the conversion efficiency, as well as the coherence properties, of the harmonics generated in macroscopic media.},

We discuss the role of atomic dipole matrix elements, electron rescattering processes, and of depletion of the ground state. We present the exact quantum-mechanical formula for the harmonic cutoff that differs from the phenomenological law Ip+3.17Up, where Ip is the atomic ionization potential and Up is the ponderomotive energy, due to the account for quantum tunneling and diffusion effects.},

The single-atom emission rates are obtained by integrating the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ an improved atomic model which includes excitation and ionization through states with both low-lying ionic cores. The propagation equations are solved using a general and efficient finite-difference technique. Excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained. We consider the effect of the defocusing of the pump beam by the free electrons in the saturation regime, and find it to be small for the conditions studied here. The spatial, temporal, and spectral profiles of the harmonic emission are presented. Significant blueshifts of the harmonics' spectral line shapes are observed in the saturation regime. Finally, using model polarizations, we discuss how the harmonic fields build up in the nonlinear medium, through a series of interferences. It allows us to understand why efficient phase matching can be achieved in a strong-field regime for the laser-atom interaction.},

  abstract = {The observation of any atomic and molecular dynamics requires a probe that has a timescale comparable to the dynamics itself. Ever since the invention of laser, the temporal duration of the laser pulse has been incrementally reduced from several nanoseconds to just attoseconds. Picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses have been widely used to study molecular rotation and vibration. In 2001, the first single isolated attosecond pulse (1 attosecond = 10-18 seconds.) was demonstrated. Since this breakthrough, ``attoscience'' has become a hot topic in ultrafast physics. Attosecond pulses typically have span between EUV to X-ray photon energies and subfemtosecond pulse duration. It becomes an ideal tool for experimentalists to study ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and condensed matter. The conventional scheme for generating attosecond pulses is focusing an intense femtosecond laser pulse into inert gases. The bound electrons are ionized into continuum through tunneling ionization under the strong electrical field. After ionization, the free electron will be accelerated by the laser field away from the parent ion and then recombined with its parent ion and releases its kinetic energy as a photon burst that lasts for a few hundred attoseconds. According to the classical ``three-step model'', high order harmonic will have a higher cutoff photon energy when driven by a longer wavelength laser field. Compared to Ti:sapphire lasers center at a wavelength of 800 nm, an optical parametric amplifier could offer a broad bandwidth at infrared range, which could support few cycle pulses for driving high harmonic generation in the X-ray spectrum range. In this work, an optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification system was developed to deliver CEP-stable 3-mJ, 12-fs pulses centered at 1.7 micron. We implement a chirped-pump technique to phase match the board parametric amplification bandwidth with high conversion efficiency. Using such a laser source, isolated attosecond pulses with photon exceeding 300 eV are achieved by applying the polarization gating technique at 1.7 micron. The intrinsic positive chirp of the attosecond pulses is measured by the attosecond streak camera and retrieved with our PROOF technique. Sn metal filters with negative dispersion were chosen to compensate the intrinsic attochirp. As a result, isolated 53-attosecond soft x-ray pulses are achieved. Such water window attosecond source will be a powerful tool for studying charge distribution/migration in bio-molecules and will bring opportunities to study high field physics or attochemistry.},

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption spectra near the energies of autoionizing states are analyzed in terms of the photon coupling mechanisms to other states. In a recent experiment, the autoionization lifetimes of highly excited states of xenon were determined and compared to a simple expression based on a model of how quantum coherence determines the decay of a metastable state in the transient absorption spectrum. Here it is shown that this procedure for extracting lifetimes is more general and can be used in cases involving either resonant or nonresonant coupling of the attosecond-probed autoionizing state to either continua or discrete states by a time-delayed near infrared (NIR) pulse. The fits of theoretically simulated absorption signals for the 6p resonance in xenon (lifetime = 21.1 fs) to this expression yield the correct decay constant for all the coupling mechanisms considered, properly recovering the time signature of twice the autoionization lifetime due to the coherent nature of the transient absorption experiment. To distinguish between these two coupling cases, the characteristic dependencies of the transient absorption signals on both the photon energy and time delay are investigated. Additional oscillations versus delay-time in the measured spectrum are shown and quantum beat analysis is used to pinpoint the major photon-coupling mechanism induced by the NIR pulse in the current xenon experiment: the NIR pulse resonantly couples the attosecondprobed state, 6p, to an intermediate 8s (at 22.563 eV), and this 8s state is also coupled to a neighboring state (at 20.808 eV).},

These new light sources can be harnessed via pump-probe spectroscopy to elucidate ultrafast quantum dynamics in atoms, molecules, and condensed matter with unprecedented time resolution and chemical sensitivity. Employing such ultrashort pulses in transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy combines the unique advantages of core-level absorption probing of chemical environments and oxidation states with the ability to obtain ultimately freeze-frame snapshots of electronic and nuclear dynamics. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the progress in applying the recently developed technique of femtosecond to attosecond time-resolved soft X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy to the study of ultrafast phenomena, including some of our own efforts to elucidate the interaction of intense laser pulses with atoms and molecules in the strong-field, nonperturbative limit.

The harmonic emission strengths, first decrease rather steeply for the first orders, then form a long plateau up to the 21st harmonic in xenon, or up to the 33rd harmonic in argon, before decreasing again rather abruptly. The theoretical description of these experiments consists first in the calculation of the photoemission spectra emitted by a single atom. The spectra are obtained by numerically integrating a time dependent Schrodinger equation for the laser-excited rare-gas atom. Second, one must account for collective effects in the medium, described by Maxwell's equations. A theoretical framework for describing the generation and propagation of harmonics in strong laser fields is developed. An numerical solution of the propagation equations for the harmonic fields in xenon at 1064 nm provides results which agree well with experimental data.},

Many resonances have been observed in the photo-ionization continuum, which are caused by electronic excitation to auto-ionizing states of Ar i. In the region between 27 and 40 eV the observed structure is due to two types of electronic excitation: (i) the excitation of a single 3s electron, resulting in the configuration 3s3p6np and (ii) the excitation of two of the outer 3p electrons simultaneously, resulting in configurations of the type 3s23p4nln{${'}$}l{${'}$}. Between 44 and 59 eV, weak structures have been observed in the absorption continuum because of the simultaneous excitation of a 3s and a 3p electron, resulting in configurations of the type 3s3p5nln{${'}$}l{${'}$}. All of the observed resonances have been tabulated, and a partial classification has been given.

The experimental measurements range from 4801 to 20586 \AA. The absolute refractivity at 760 torr, 0\textdegree C, 5462.258 \AA{} is 3.4950\texttimes 10-5. A dispersion formula describing the data is (n-1)\texttimes 105=1470.091/(423.98-{$\sigma$}2).Other dispersion formulas are discussed. The experimental and theoretical computations are compared with the experimental and theoretical work of various authors. The comparison includes computations of effective F values, absorption wavelength, dielectric constant, molecular polarizability, and Verdet constant.},

  abstract = {Dynamics following excitation with attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses arise from enormous numbers of accessible excited states, complicating the retrieval of state-specific time evolutions. We develop attosecond XUV multidimensional spectroscopy here to separate interfering pathways on a near-infrared (NIR) energy axis, retrieving single state dynamics in argon atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) XUV-NIR spectrum. In this experiment, we measure four-wave mixing signal arising from the interaction of XUV attosecond pulses centered around 15 eV with two few-cycle NIR pulses. The 2D spectrum is created by measuring the emitted XUV signal field spectrum while applying narrowband amplitude and phase modulations to one of the NIR pulses. Application of such a technique to systems of high dimensionality will provide for the observation of state-resolved pure electronic dynamics, in direct analogy to phenomena unraveled by multidimensional spectroscopies at optical frequencies.},

  abstract = {A metal-semiconductor heterojunction is investigated by Auger and photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the metallic film and to obtain the time-resolved electronic response induced by femtosecond laser excitation of the semiconductor material. The 3.5 monolayer (ML) Zn films deposited on p-type Si(100) at liquid nitrogen temperature grows in a layer-by-layer fashion. Electronic structure measurements by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the films are metallic in nature, creating a Schottky barrier at the 3.5 ML Zn/p-Si(100) interface. Utilizing a 35 fs, 800 nm pump pulse at a pump intensity of (2.5-6) \texttimes{} 109 W/cm2 to excite the Si and a time-delayed extreme ultraviolet pulse to probe the Zn, we observed large transient surface photovoltage shifts of 0.3-2.2 eV at carrier densities of (1.5-4.5) \texttimes{} 1020 cm-3. Three shifts are determined the Zn 3d core level, the photoemission onset, and the metallic Fermi level. The photovoltages increase with laser excitation intensity, and the Zn 3d core level exhibits the largest binding energy shifts due to pronounced screening of the core level. The large observed shifts are rationalized on the basis of the energetics of band flattening and carrier accumulation in the metallic layer of the Zn/p-Si(100) heterojunction at high carrier densities. The observed carrier recombination dynamics are biexponential in character, with similar time constants for both the Zn 3d and photoemission onset binding energy shifts. The Zn 3d core level shifts are also found to be sensitive to the electron temperature. These results show that core-level photoemission can be used to monitor valence electron dynamics, allowing separation of charge dynamics in heterojunctions and solids composed of multiple elements.},

  abstract = {The development of attosecond technology is one of the most significant recent achievements in the field of ultrafast optics; it opens up new frontiers in atomic and molecular spectroscopy and dynamics. A unique attosecond pumpprobe apparatus using a compact Mach-Zehnder interferometer is developed. The interferometer system is compact ({$\sim$}290 cm2) and completely located outside of the vacuum chamber. The location reduces the mechanical vibration from vacuum components such as turbopumps and roughing pumps. The stability of the interferometer is {$\sim$}50 as RMS over 24 hours, stabilized with an active feedback loop. The pump and probe fields can be easily altered to incorporate multiple colors. In the interferometer, double optical gating optics are arranged to generate isolated attosecond pulses with a supercontinuum spectrum. The frequencies of the attosecond pulses can be selected to be in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region (25\textendash 55 eV, 140 as) or the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region (15\textendash 24 eV, {$\sim$}400 as) by metal filters. Furthermore, the near infrared probe field (1.65 eV) can be upconverted to the ultraviolet (3.1 eV). The frequency tunability in the XUV and VUV is critical for selecting excited states of target atoms and molecules.},

  abstract = {Attosecond multidimensional interferometry of single and two correlated electrons in atoms\textemdash Within this work, electron dynamics in atoms are experimentally and numerically investigated on their natural attosecond time scales. To access these dynamics, ultrashort and moderately-intense few-cycle laser pulses are superposed with attosecond pulsed radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Both these sources are combined in a new experimental vacuum setup which was designed and built up from scratch, also in order to generate the attosecond pulses. Novel experimental schemes are developed which involve the temporal and spectral interferometric utilization of both ultrashort light sources and include the multidimensional spectroscopy employing different dynamical parameters. These are the intensity and the carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulses, as well as their temporal delay with respect to the attosecond pulses. Scientifically, the observation and control of the quantum-motion of bound electrons, as well as the laserdriven quasi-classical motion of free electrons was a key goal of this work. In particular, a bound two-electron wave packet in helium on attosecond time scales was experimentally observed for the first time. This was realized by combining unprecedented high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, a new coupling mechanism of several doubly-excited states to an effective single-electron continuum is identified and analyzed. Both these two-electron states as well as single-electron states are interferometrically investigated with access to the phase of their quantum-mechanical wave function. This allows the observation and control of the quantum dynamics of two correlated electrons in atoms on the attosecond time scale which was demonstrated within the scope of this work.},

Aim of the proposed configuration is to provide a micro-focused image through a high demagnification of the XUV source with the following characteristics: i) almost negligible aberrations; ii) long exit arm to easily accommodate at the output the experimental setups required for the applications of the focused attosecond pulses; iii) possibility to have an intermediate region where the XUV beam is collimated, in order to insert a plane split-mirror for the generation of two XUV pulse replicas to be used in a XUV-pump/XUV-probe setup. We present the analytical and numerical study of two optical configurations characterized by two sections based on the use of toroidal mirrors. The first section provides a demagnified image of the source in an intermediate focus that is free from defocusing but has a large coma aberration. The second section consists of a relay mirror that is mounted in Z-shaped geometry with respect to the previous one, in order to give a stigmatic image with a coma that is opposite to that provided by the first section. An example is provided to demonstrate the capability to achieve spot sizes in the 5-15 {$\mu$}m range with a demagnification higher than 10 in a compact envelope.},

  abstract = {Using the extreme nonlinear optical process of high harmonic generation, light from an ultrafast infrared laser can be coherently upconverted to generate fully co-herent and laser-like beams in the extreme ultraviolet region of the spectrum, with femtosecond-to-attosecond pulse duration. However, progress in extending extreme non-linear optical techniques into the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum has been hindered to-date, not by the inability of the high harmonic process to generate X-rays, but by the lack of techniques for phase matching this highly nonlinear process. This thesis reports on significant experimental and theoretical advances in two alternative approaches to obtain bright high harmonic emission at keV photon energies. First, using high harmonic generation from ions in a plasma waveguide, it was demonstrated that one can extend significantly the energy range of the generated photons by increasing the laser intensity. At high driving \textasciimacron elds, the plasma waveguide prevents laser defocusing, reduces ionization loses, allows to design the ion species independently from the laser dynamics, and provides more uniform propagation conditions amenable to apply quasi phase matching techniques. All-optical quasi phase matching techniques - high-order difference-frequency mixing and grating-assisted phase matching - are proposed in this scheme. Second, in a contrasting regime, using high harmonic generation from weakly-ionized neutral atoms in a hollow waveguide and by increasing the driving laser wavelength, it is shown for the first time that there is no maximum photon energy limit for perfect phase matching of the process. In the past decade prior to our demonstration, it was widely accepted that conventional phase matching of high harmonic generation is limited to about 100 eV. In analogy with the single-atom cuto\textregistered energy in a microscopic picture, we introduce the concept of a phase matching cuto\textregistered energy in a macroscopic picture. A simple phase-matching cuto\textregistered{} rule is obtained, describing the maximum photon energy that can be fully phase-matched as a function of the laser wavelength. We verify our scaling predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum (inside the water window of the spectrum), using ultrafast mid-IR driving laser pulses and extended, high pressure, weakly ionized gas medium. We also show through calculations that scaling of the overall conversion e{$\pm$}ciency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making tabletop, fully coherent, multi-keV X-ray sources feasible. The rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield, predicted for harmonics driven by longer-wavelength lasers, is compensated macroscopically by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated X-rays. In addition, this simple and experimentally attractive regime represents prospects to macroscopically isolate femtosecond-to-attosecond-to-zeptosecond x-ray pulses through phase matching gating. The perfect phase matching and quasi phase matching techniques presented here can provide either broadband or quasi-monochromatic, tunable, ultrafast light in the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum that can be used for applications in microscopy, nanoscience and nanotechnology, X-ray nonlinear optics, as well as wide range of fundamental studies of materials and molecular dynamics.},

Extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to measure small polaron formation rates and probabilities in goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) crystalline nanorods at pump photon energies from 2.2 to 3.1 eV. The measured polaron formation time increases with excitation photon energy from 70 {$\pm$} 10 fs at 2.2 eV to 350 {$\pm$} 30 fs at 2.6 eV, whereas the polaron formation probability (85 {$\pm$} 10\%) remains constant. By comparison to hematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3), an oxide analogue, the role of ligand composition and metal center density in small polaron formation time is discussed. This work suggests that incorporating small changes in ligands and crystal structure could enable the control of photoexcited small polaron formation in metal oxides.},

Until now, such sources have been limited to repetition rates of 1 kHz or less, which restricts count rates and signal-to-noise ratio for a variety of experiments. SXR generation at high repetition rate has remained challenging because of the missing high-power infrared laser sources to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. Here we present an optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier (OPCPA) centered at a wavelength of 2.2 \textmu m and generating 16.5 fs pulses (2.2 oscillation cycles of the carrier wave) with 25 W of average power and a peak power exceeding 14 GW at 100 kHz pulse repetition rate. This corresponds to the highest reported peak power for high-repetition-rate long-wavelength laser systems. The output of this 2.2 \textmu m OPCPA system was used to generate a coherent SXR radiation extending beyond 0.6 keV through HHG in a high-pressure gas cell.},

This review provides an overview of recent attosecond measurements, focusing on the wealth of knowledge obtained by the application of isolated attosecond pulses in studying dynamics in gases and solid-state systems. Attosecond photoelectron and photoion measurements in atoms reveal strong-field tunneling ionization and a delay in the photoemission from different electronic states. These measurements applied to molecules have shed light on ultrafast intramolecular charge migration. Similar approaches are used to understand photoemission processes from core and delocalized electronic states in metal surfaces. Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is used to follow the real-time motion of valence electrons and to measure the lifetimes of autoionizing channels in atoms. In solids, it provides the first measurements of bulk electron dynamics, revealing important phenomena such as the timescales governing the switching from an insulator to a metallic state and carrier-carrier interactions.},

  abstract = {As a compact and burgeoning alternative to synchrotron radiation and free-electron lasers, high harmonic generation (HHG) has proven its superiority in static and time-resolved extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy for the past two decades and has recently gained many interests and successes in generating soft x-ray emissions covering the biologically important water window spectral region. Unlike synchrotron and free-electron sources, which suffer from relatively long pulse width or large time jitter, soft x-ray sources from HHG could offer attosecond time resolution and be synchronized with their driving field to investigate time-resolved near edge absorption spectroscopy, which could reveal rich structural and dynamical information of the interrogated samples. In this paper, we review recent progresses on generating and characterizing attosecond light sources in the water window region. We show our development of an energetic, two-cycle, carrier-envelope phase stable laser source at 1.7 {$\mu$}m and our achievement in producing a 53 as soft x-ray pulse covering the carbon K-edge in the water window. Such source paves the ways for the next generation x-ray spectroscopy with unprecedented temporal resolution.},

So far the conversion efficiencies that have been achieved in this regime are orders of magnitude behind the values that have been demonstrated with loose focusing of high energy (high peak power) lasers. In this contribution, we discuss the scaling laws for the main physical quantities of HHG and in particular analyze the limiting effects: dephasing, absorption and plasma defocusing. It turns out that phase-matched and absorption-limited HHG can be achieved even for very small focal spot sizes using a target gas provided with an adequately high density. Experimentally, we investigate HHG in a gas jet of argon, krypton and xenon. By analyzing the pressure dependence we are able to disentangle the dephasing and absorption effects and prove that the generated high order harmonics are phase-matched and absorption-limited. The obtained conversion efficiency is as high as 8 \texttimes{} 10-6 for the 17th harmonic generated in xenon and 1.4 \texttimes{} 10-6 for the 27th harmonic generated in argon. Our findings pave the way for highly efficient harmonic generation at megahertz repetition rates.},

  abstract = {The amplitude and phase of the complex photoionization/photorecombination dipole matrix element of atoms and simple linear molecules is measured with sub-femtosecond time resolution and sub-electronvolt spectral resolution using High Harmonic Spectroscopy (HHS). The first known measurement of the dipole phase jump at a Cooper minimum is reported for the 3p orbital of argon. Also, the angle-dependent dipole of nitrogen is measured using rotationally-aligned molecular ensembles. In contrast with previous studies, which were limited by traditional shorter-wavelength near-infrared laser sources, only a single orbital is sufficient to explain the nitrogen results, which are in excellent agreement with accurate theoretical scattering-wave dipole calculations. All of these experiments benefit from the extended extreme-ultraviolet cutoff, and improved spectral resolution, afforded by the use of long-wavelength mid-infrared driving laser sources. This work extends our understanding of the interaction of light and matter on the timescale of the electron's motion, the attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s). The experimental results presented here lend credence to the methodology of molecular self-imaging by laser induced ionization and recombination of a molecule's own electron. The successes and limitations of HHS as a tool for ultrafast atomic and molecular imaging are discussed. Finally, the feasibility is examined of using HHS to measure the temporal evolution of complicated chemical dynamics with attosecond precision.},

Recent numerical studies predict that high harmonic efficiency falls dramatically with increasing wavelength, with a very unfavorable {$\lambda-$}(5-6) scaling. We performed an experimental study of the high harmonic yield over a wavelength range of 800\textendash 1850 nm. A thin gas jet was employed to minimize phase matching effects, and the laser intensity and focal spot size were kept constant as the wavelength was changed. Ion yield was simultaneously measured so that the total number of emitting atoms was known. We found that the scaling at constant laser intensity is {$\lambda-$}6.3{$\pm$}1.1 in Xe and {$\lambda-$}6.5{$\pm$}1.1 in Kr over the wavelength range of 800\textendash 1850 nm, somewhat worse than the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of a gas flow through a capillary being a part of mass spectrometer atmospheric interface were performed using a detailed laminar flow model. The simulated interface consisted of atmospheric and forevacuum volumes connected via a thin capillary. The pressure in the forevacuum volume where the gas was expanding after passing through the capillary was varied in the wide range from 10 to 900 mbar in order to study the volume flow rate as well as the other flow parameters as functions of the pressure drop between the atmospheric and forevacuum volumes. The capillary wall temperature was varied in the range from 24 to 150 \textdegree C. Numerical integration of the complete system of Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous compressible gas taking into account the heat transfer was performed using the standard gas dynamic simulation software package ANSYS CFX. The simulation results were compared with experimental measurements of gas flow parameters both performed using our experimental setup and taken from the literature. The simulated volume flow rates through the capillary differed no more than by 10\% from the measured ones over the entire pressure and temperatures ranges. A conclusion was drawn that the detailed digital laminar model is able to quantitatively describe the measured gas flow rates through the capillaries under conditions considered.},

The emission provides a snapshot of the structure and dynamics of the recombining system, encoded in the amplitudes, phases and polarization of the harmonic light. Here we show with CO2 molecules that high harmonic interferometry can retrieve this structural and dynamic information: by measuring the phases and amplitudes of the harmonic emission, we reveal `fingerprints' of multiple molecular orbitals participating in the process and decode the underlying attosecond multi-electron dynamics, including the dynamics of electron rearrangement upon ionization. These findings establish high harmonic interferometry as an effective approach to resolving multi-electron dynamics with sub-\AA ngstr\"om spatial resolution arising from the de Broglie wavelength of the recombining electron, and attosecond temporal resolution arising from the timescale of the recombination event.},

It is shown using a time-independent resonant scattering approach that the Fano parametrization may be applied to overlapping resonances. For the Dubau-Seaton profile an exact expression of the closed-channel phase shift is obtained. We find that regarding the window character of the Ar 3s series the Fano parameters calculated using the multichannel multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method are in good agreement with those derived from fitting a convoluted Fano function to the measured n=4 autoionizing resonance. The Fano parameters are also derived from perfect fits to the 5{$\leq$}n{$\leq$}8 resonances which tests the validity of this parametrization to overlapping members of an inner-valence electron resonance series. In contrast, a parametrization of the entire series based upon the Dubau-Seaton formula did not result in a good fit without modifications. Using the same value of the shape parameter we find, however, that the n=4 resonance can be accurately represented by both the Fano and Dubau-Seaton profiles.},

The calculations use a numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in argon and the strong-field approximation in helium. The scaling of electron energies ({$\lambda$}2), harmonic cutoff ({$\lambda$}2), and attochirp ({$\lambda-$}1) agree with classical mechanics, but it is found that, surprisingly, the harmonic yield follows a {$\lambda-$}(5\textendash 6) scaling at constant intensity. In addition, the TDSE results reveal an unexpected contribution from higher-order returns of the rescattering electron wave packet.},

  abstract = {Wide band gap heterostructures can be accurately fabricated at room temperature to exhibit remarkable electrical properties that facilitate the transfer of electrons across the heterojunction while blocking the transfer of holes. The present investigation focuses on engineering the electronic structure of a TiO2 overlayer on a p-type doped Si(100) substrate by controlling the concentration of TiO2 oxygen vacancies. TiO2 films are deposited on p-Si(100) in an ultrahigh vacuum setup by evaporation of Ti atoms at a constant rate in a variable O2 atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen vacancies and consequently the degree of n-type doping of TiO2 is tuned by controlling the oxygen background pressure during the TiO2 formation. To investigate the electronic structure and the concentration of defects in the TiO2 layer as well as to characterize the TiO2/p-Si(100) band alignment we used photoelectron spectroscopy employing femtosecond extreme ultraviolet laser pulses produced via high harmonic generation. Furthermore, using a pump-probe technique in conjunction with photoemission spectroscopy, an ultrafast electron injection from the p-Si(100) substrate into the defect-rich TiO2 layer is observed with a time constant of 450 fs, as well as the subsequent charge carrier recombination. The latter is revealed to be affected by the oxygen defects when investigated with femtosecond resolution. No charge transfer is observed when defect-poor TiO2 films are prepared on the p-Si(100) substrate. This might be attributed to a change in the energy band alignment at the TiO2/Si(100) interface that reduces the built-in potential across the heterojunction and consequently reduces the driving force responsible for the injection of electrons into the TiO2 layer.},

In this investigation, photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses, is used to investigate the electronic structure and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at a Si(100) surface decorated with Zn clusters. Static photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the changes in the electronic structure as the dimensionality of the Zn is increased from small clusters composed of a very few atoms to metallic Zn particles. Furthermore, femtosecond optical-pump XUV-probe photoemission spectroscopy is employed to induce a charge transfer from the p-Si(100) substrate to the Zn clusters and to measure in real time the charge trapping at the Zn cluster as well as the subsequent charge relaxation. The ultrafast charge carrier dynamics are also investigated for small clusters and metallic Zn particles. Significant transient charging of the Zn clusters after excitation of the Si(100) substrate by 800 nm light is observed for Zn coverages greater than 0.12 ML Zn, which coincides with the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the Zn particle and the p-Si(100) substrate. The transient signals show that the charge trapping time at the Zn cluster varies with the cluster size, which is rationalized based on the electronic structure of the cluster as well as the band energy alignment at the Zn cluster-Si(100) junction.},

By applying such few-cycle pulses as a driving field, single isolated attosecond pulses can be produced through the highorder harmonic generation process, which provide a novel tool for capturing the real time electron motion. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the state of the art few-cycle near infrared (NIR) laser pulse development, which includes absolute phase control (carrier-envelope phase stabilization), amplitude control (power stabilization), and relative phase control (pulse compression and shaping). Then the double optical gating (DOG) method for generating single attosecond pulses and the attosecond streaking experiment for characterizing such pulses are presented. Various experimental limitations in the attosecond streaking measurement are illustrated through simulation. Finally by using the single attosecond pulses generated by DOG, an attosecond transient absorption experiment is performed to study the autoionization process of argon. When the delay between a few-cycle NIR pulse and a single attosecond XUV pulse is scanned, the Fano resonance shapes of the argon autoionizing states are modified by the NIR pulse, which shows the direct observation and control of electron-electron correlation in the temporal domain.},

  abstract = {At present, the energy of a single isolated attosecond pulse is limited to nanojoule levels. As a result, an intense femtosecond pulse has always been used in combination with a weak attosecond pulse in time-resolved experiments. To reach the goal of conducting true attosecond pump-attosecond probe experiments, a high flux laser source has been developed that can potentially deliver microjoule level isolated attosecond pulses in the 50 eV range, and a unique experimental end station has been fabricated and implemented that can provide precision control of the attosecond-attosecond pump-probe pulses. In order to scale up the attosecond flux, a unique Ti:-Sapphire laser system with a three-stage amplifier that delivers pulses with a 2 J energy at a 10 Hz repetition rate was designed and built. The broadband pulse spectrum covering from 700 nm to 900 nm was generated, supporting a pulse duration of 12 fs. The high flux high-order harmonics were generated in a gas tube filled with argon by a loosely focused geometry under a phasematching condition. The wavefront distortions for the driving laser were corrected by a deformable mirror with a Shack-Hartmann sensor to significantly improve the extreme ultraviolet radiation conversion efficiency due to the excellent beam profile at focus. A high-damage-threshold beam splitter is demonstrated to eliminate energetic driving laser pulses from high-order harmonics. The extreme ultraviolet pulse energy is measured to be 0.3 microjoule at the exit of the argon gas target. The experimental facilities developed will lead to the generation of microjoule level isolated attosecond pulses and the demonstration of true atto pump-atto probe experiments in near future. Finally, in experiment, we show the first demonstration of carrier-envelope phase controlled filamentation in air using millijoule-level few-cycle mid-infrared laser pulses.},

First, a unique Ti:Sapphire chirped pulse amplifier laser system that delivers 14 fs pulses with 300 mJ energy at a 10 Hz repetition rate was designed and built. The broadband spectrum extending from 700 nm to 900 nm was obtained by seeding a two stage Ti:Sapphire chirped pulse power amplifier with mJ-level white light pulses from a gas filled hollow core fiber. It is the highest energy level ever achieved by a broadband pulse in a chirped pulse amplifier up to the current date. Second, using this laser as a driving laser source, the generalized double optical gating method is employed to generate isolated attosecond pulses. Detailed gate width analysis of the ellipticity dependent pulse were performed. Calculation of electron light interaction dynamics on the atomic level was carried out to demonstrate the mechanism of isolated pulse generation. Third, a complete diagnostic apparatus was built to extract and analyze the generated attosecond pulse in spectral domain. The result confirms that an extreme ultraviolet super continuum supporting 230 as isolated attosecond pulses at 35 eV was generated using the generalized double optical gating technique. The extreme ultraviolet pulse energy was {$\sim$}100 nJ at the exit of the argon gas target.},

XFELs now provide unprecedented intensity (1020 W cm-2) of x-rays at wavelengths down to {$\sim$}1 \AA ngstrom, and HHG provides unprecedented time resolution ({$\sim$}50 attoseconds) and a correspondingly large coherent bandwidth at longer wavelengths. For context, timescales can be referenced to the Bohr orbital period in hydrogen atom of 150 attoseconds and the hydrogen-molecule vibrational period of 8 femtoseconds; wavelength scales can be referenced to the chemically significant carbon K-edge at a photon energy of {$\sim$}280 eV (44 \AA ngstroms) and the bond length in methane of {$\sim$}1 \AA ngstrom. With these modern x-ray sources one now has the ability to focus on individual atoms, even when embedded in a complex molecule, and view electronic and nuclear motion on their intrinsic scales (attoseconds and \AA ngstroms). These sources have enabled coherent diffractive imaging, where one can image non-crystalline objects in three dimensions on ultrafast timescales, potentially with atomic resolution. The unprecedented intensity available with XFELs has opened new fields of multiphoton and nonlinear x-ray physics where behavior of matter under extreme conditions can be explored. The unprecedented time resolution and pulse synchronization provided by HHG sources has kindled fundamental investigations of time delays in photoionization, charge migration in molecules, and dynamics near conical intersections that are foundational to AMO physics and chemistry. This roadmap coincides with the year when three new XFEL facilities, operating at \AA ngstrom wavelengths, opened for users (European XFEL, Swiss-FEL and PAL-FEL in Korea) almost doubling the present worldwide number of XFELs, and documents the remarkable progress in HHG capabilities since its discovery roughly 30 years ago, showcasing experiments in AMO physics and other applications. Here we capture the perspectives of 17 leading groups and organize the contributions into four categories: ultrafast molecular dynamics, multidimensional x-ray spectroscopies; high-intensity x-ray phenomena; attosecond x-ray science.},

These facilities typically provide two-dimensional nanofocusing X-ray beams by combining one-dimensional focusing mirrors. However, single-reflecting two-dimensional focusing mirrors with an ellipsoidal surface, which are well-known to possess high efficiency, have limited microfocusing applications. In this paper, we present an ultrahigh-precision ellipsoidal mirror for two-dimensional X-ray nanofocusing by overcoming the difficulties faced in the manufacturing process of its aspherical surface, including the surface-processing methods and surface metrology. The developed mirror has nanoscale accuracy, and it achieves focus size of 85\,nm\,\texttimes\,125\,nm (full width at half maximum) using 7-keV X-rays. Two-dimensional focus was demonstrated in the same focal plane by resolving 50-nm test structures by scanning X-ray microscopy using a focusing beam. These achievements represent an important first step toward realizing two-dimensional aspherical mirrors with complex designs, in addition to ultralow loss and unprecedented small focusing property for extensive optical applications in synchrotron-radiation and XFEL facilities as well as in other scientific fields that require ultraprecision optical surfaces.},

  abstract = {Dynamics occurring on microscopic scales, such as electronic motion inside atoms and molecules, are governed by quantum mechanics. However, the Schr\"odinger equation is usually too complicated to solve analytically for systems other than the hydrogen atom. Even for some simple atoms such as helium, it still takes months to do a full numerical analysis. Therefore, practical problems are often solved only after simplification. The results are then compared with the experimental outcome in both the spectral and temporal domain. For accurate experimental comparison, temporal resolution on the attosecond scale is required. This had not been achieved until the first demonstration of the single attosecond pulse in 2001. After this breakthrough, ``attophysics'' immediately became a hot field in the physics and optics community.  While the attosecond pulse has served as an irreplaceable tool in many fundamental research studies of ultrafast dynamics, the pulse generation process itself is an interesting topic in the ultrafast field. When an intense femtosecond laser is tightly focused on a gaseous target, electrons inside the neutral atoms are ripped away through tunneling ionization. Under certain circumstances, the electrons are able to reunite with the parent ions and release photon bursts lasting only tens to hundreds of attoseconds. This process repeats itself every half cycle of the driving pulse, generating a train of single attosecond pulses which lasts longer than one femtosecond. To achieve true temporal resolution on the attosecond time scale, single isolated attosecond pulses are required, meaning only one attosecond pulse can be produced per driving pulse. Up to now, there are only a few methods which have been demonstrated experimentally to generate isolated attosecond pulses. Pioneering work generated single attosecond pulse using a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized 3.3 fs laser pulse, which is out of reach for most research groups. An alternative method termed as polarization gating generated single attosecond pulses with 5 fs driving pulses, which is still difficult to achieve experimentally. Most recently, a new technique termed as Double Optical Gating (DOG) was developed in our group to allow the generation of single attosecond pulse with longer driving pulse durations. For example, isolated 150 as pulses were demonstrated with a 25 fs driving laser directly from a commerciallyavailable Ti:Sapphire amplifier. Isolated attosecond pulses as short as 107 as have been demonstrated with the DOG scheme before this work. Here, we employ this method to shorten the pulse duration even further, demonstrating world-record isolated 67 as pulses.  Optical pulses with attosecond duration are the shortest controllable process up to now and are much faster than the electron response times in any electronic devices. In consequence, it is also a challenge to characterize attosecond pulses experimentally, especially when they feature a broadband spectrum. Similar challenges have previously been met in characterizing femtosecond laser pulses, with many schemes already proposed and well-demonstrated experimentally. Similar schemes can be applied in characterizing attosecond pulses with narrow bandwidth. The limitation of these techniques is presented here, and a method recently developed to overcome those limitations is discussed. At last, several experimental advances toward the characterization of the isolated 25 as pulses, which is one atomic unit time, are discussed briefly.},
