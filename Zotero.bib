  abstract = {High-order harmonic emission can be confined to the leading edge of an 800 nm driver laser pulse under moderately intense focusing conditions (7\texttimes{}1014 W/cm2) (Pfeifer et al. in Opt. Express 15:17120, 2007). Here, the experimentally observed curtailment of harmonic production on the leading edge of the driver pulse is shown to be controlled by an ionization-induced phase-matching condition. The transient plasma density inherent to the process of highharmonic generation terminates the harmonic emission by an ultrafast loss of phase matching on the leading edge of the laser pulse. The analysis is supported by a reconstruction of the in situ intensity envelope of the driver pulse with attosecond temporal resolution, performed by measurements of the carrier-envelope phase dependence of individual half-cycle harmonic cutoffs. The method opens the way to wavelengthtunable isolated attosecond pulse generation.},

The results of such studies address a wide array of scientific and technological applications. Here, the current state-of-the-art of attosecond-dynamics measurements is reviewed and several novel spectroscopic methods are discussed that are particularly important for applications in chemical physics: attosecond transient absorption/dispersion spectroscopy, laser-induced-dipole spectroscopy, and absolute-phase spectroscopy.},

Half-cycle cutoff analysis confirms that harmonic generation proceeds in the ionizationgated regime. The attosecond pulse contrast is measured using the technique of carrier\textendash{}envelope phase (CEP)-scanning, recently developed by our group, in which photoelectrons generated from Ne atoms by the harmonic pulse are streaked as a function of CEP. Streaking of photoelectrons as a function of attosecond time delay also confirms the isolated nature of the harmonic pulse, which is measured to have a duration of 430 {\AE} 15 as, limited by the bandwidth of the reflective X-ray optics employed. The combined measurements imply that the experimental advantages of the ionization gating technique\textemdash{}tunable X-ray emission, relaxed sensitivity to the CEP and scalability to longer driver pulses\textemdash{}are also conferred on isolated attosecond pulse production.},

Employing such ultrashort pulses in transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy combines the unique advantages of core-level absorption probing of chemical environments and oxidation states with the ability to obtain ultimately freeze-frame snapshots of electronic and nuclear dynamics. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the progress in applying the recently developed technique of femtosecond to attosecond time-resolved soft X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy to the study of ultrafast phenomena, including some of our own efforts to elucidate the interaction of intense laser pulses with atoms and molecules in the strong-field, nonperturbative limit.

A unique attosecond pumpprobe apparatus using a compact Mach-Zehnder interferometer is developed. The interferometer system is compact ({$\sim$}290 cm2) and completely located outside of the vacuum chamber. The location reduces the mechanical vibration from vacuum components such as turbopumps and roughing pumps. The stability of the interferometer is {$\sim$}50 as RMS over 24 hours, stabilized with an active feedback loop. The pump and probe fields can be easily altered to incorporate multiple colors. In the interferometer, double optical gating optics are arranged to generate isolated attosecond pulses with a supercontinuum spectrum. The frequencies of the attosecond pulses can be selected to be in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region (25\textendash{}55 eV, 140 as) or the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region (15\textendash{}24 eV, {$\sim$}400 as) by metal filters. Furthermore, the near infrared probe field (1.65 eV) can be upconverted to the ultraviolet (3.1 eV). The frequency tunability in the XUV and VUV is critical for selecting excited states of target atoms and molecules.},

All of the initially excited states are monitored simultaneously in the attosecond transient absorption spectrum, revealing Lorentzian to Fano lineshape spectral changes as well as quantum beats. The most prominent beating of the several that were observed was in the spin\textendash{}orbit split 3d absorption features, which has a 40 femtosecond period that corresponds to the spin\textendash{}orbit splitting of 0.1 eV.

  abstract = {The identities of photoexcited states in thin-film Co3O4 and the ultrafast carrier relaxation dynamics of Co3O4 are investigated with oxidation-state-specific pump-probe femtosecond core level spectroscopy. A thin-film sample is excited near the 2.8 eV optical absorption peak, and the resulting spectral changes at the 58.9 eV M2,3edge of cobalt are probed in transient absorption with femtosecond highorder harmonic pulses generated by a Ti/sapphire laser. The initial transient state shows a significant 2 eV redshift in the absorption edge compared to the static ground state, which indicates a reduction of the cobalt valence charge. This is confirmed by a charge transfer multiplet spectral simulation, which finds the experimentally observed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectrum matches the specific O2-(2p) \textrightarrow{} Co3+(eg) charge-transfer transition, out of six possible excitation pathways involving Co3+ and Co2+ in the mixed-valence material. The initial transient state has a power-dependent amplitude decay (190 {$\pm$} 10 fs at 13.2 mJ/cm2) together with a slight redshift in spectral shape (535 {$\pm$} 33 fs), which are ascribed to hot carrier relaxation to the band edge. The faster amplitude decay is possibly due to a decrease of charge carrier density via an Auger mechanism, as the decay rate increases when more excitation fluence is used. This study takes advantage of the oxidation-state-specificity of time-resolved XUV spectroscopy, further establishing the method as a new approach to measure ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in condensed-phase systems.},

  abstract = {Charge carrier dynamics in Co3O4 thin films are observed using high harmonic generation transient absorption spectroscopy at the Co M2,3 edge. Results reveal that photoexcited Co3O4 decays to the ground state in 600 {$\pm$} 40 ps in liquid methanol compared to 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3 ns in vacuum. Kinetic analysis suggests that surface-mediated relaxation of photoexcited Co3O4 may be the result of hole transfer from Co3O4 followed by carrier recombination at the Co3O4-methanol interface.},

  abstract = {The broad bandwidth of an isolated attosecond pulse excites a vast number of states simultaneously, and the corresponding absorption features can be monitored with exceptional temporal resolution. Novel transient absorption experiments in gases using isolated attosecond pulses are performed in two regimes, one in which the attosecond pulse is overlapped in time with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse and one in which the NIR pulse follows the attosecond pulse. In the latter regime, the attosecond pulse first interacts with a sample, then the observed absorption features are modified by a NIR pulse, which interacts with the sample well after the attosecond pulse has passed. In these experiments, which seem counterintuitive when compared to conventional transient absorption spectroscopy, the weak attosecond pulse induces a polarization of the medium, which is then perturbed by the time-delayed NIR pulse. Recent measurements demonstrate the rich variety of information that can be extracted in this regime.},

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption spectra near the energies of autoionizing states are analyzed in terms of the photon coupling mechanisms to other states. In a recent experiment, the autoionization lifetimes of highly excited states of xenon were determined and compared to a simple expression based on a model of how quantum coherence determines the decay of a metastable state in the transient absorption spectrum. Here it is shown that this procedure for extracting lifetimes is more general and can be used in cases involving either resonant or nonresonant coupling of the attosecond-probed autoionizing state to either continua or discrete states by a time-delayed near infrared (NIR) pulse. The fits of theoretically simulated absorption signals for the 6p resonance in xenon (lifetime = 21.1 fs) to this expression yield the correct decay constant for all the coupling mechanisms considered, properly recovering the time signature of twice the autoionization lifetime due to the coherent nature of the transient absorption experiment. To distinguish between these two coupling cases, the characteristic dependencies of the transient absorption signals on both the photon energy and time delay are investigated. Additional oscillations versus delay-time in the measured spectrum are shown and quantum beat analysis is used to pinpoint the major photon-coupling mechanism induced by the NIR pulse in the current xenon experiment: the NIR pulse resonantly couples the attosecondprobed state, 6p, to an intermediate 8s (at 22.563 eV), and this 8s state is also coupled to a neighboring state (at 20.808 eV).},

This review provides an overview of recent attosecond measurements, focusing on the wealth of knowledge obtained by the application of isolated attosecond pulses in studying dynamics in gases and solid-state systems. Attosecond photoelectron and photoion measurements in atoms reveal strong-field tunneling ionization and a delay in the photoemission from different electronic states. These measurements applied to molecules have shed light on ultrafast intramolecular charge migration. Similar approaches are used to understand photoemission processes from core and delocalized electronic states in metal surfaces. Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is used to follow the real-time motion of valence electrons and to measure the lifetimes of autoionizing channels in atoms. In solids, it provides the first measurements of bulk electron dynamics, revealing important phenomena such as the timescales governing the switching from an insulator to a metallic state and carrier-carrier interactions.},

  abstract = {Wide band gap heterostructures can be accurately fabricated at room temperature to exhibit remarkable electrical properties that facilitate the transfer of electrons across the heterojunction while blocking the transfer of holes. The present investigation focuses on engineering the electronic structure of a TiO2 overlayer on a p-type doped Si(100) substrate by controlling the concentration of TiO2 oxygen vacancies. TiO2 films are deposited on p-Si(100) in an ultrahigh vacuum setup by evaporation of Ti atoms at a constant rate in a variable O2 atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen vacancies and consequently the degree of n-type doping of TiO2 is tuned by controlling the oxygen background pressure during the TiO2 formation. To investigate the electronic structure and the concentration of defects in the TiO2 layer as well as to characterize the TiO2/p-Si(100) band alignment we used photoelectron spectroscopy employing femtosecond extreme ultraviolet laser pulses produced via high harmonic generation. Furthermore, using a pump-probe technique in conjunction with photoemission spectroscopy, an ultrafast electron injection from the p-Si(100) substrate into the defect-rich TiO2 layer is observed with a time constant of 450 fs, as well as the subsequent charge carrier recombination. The latter is revealed to be affected by the oxygen defects when investigated with femtosecond resolution. No charge transfer is observed when defect-poor TiO2 films are prepared on the p-Si(100) substrate. This might be attributed to a change in the energy band alignment at the TiO2/Si(100) interface that reduces the built-in potential across the heterojunction and consequently reduces the driving force responsible for the injection of electrons into the TiO2 layer.},

A time-delayed, few-femtosecond, near-infrared (NIR) laser pulse is used to couple individual states in the wavepacket to multiple neighboring states, resulting in time-dependent modification of the absorption spectrum and revealing both individual quantum beats of the wavepacket and the energy shifts of the excited states in the presence of the strong NIR field. The broad bandwidth of the attosecond pulse and high energy resolution of the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer allow the simultaneous observation of time-dependent dynamics for many individual vibrational levels in each electronic state. Quantum beating with periods from 1.3 to 12 fs and transient line shape changes are observed among vibrational levels of a progression of electronically autoionizing Rydberg states leading to the excited A 2{$\Pi$}u N2+ ion core. Vibrational levels in the valence b 1{$\Pi$}u state exhibit 50 fs oscillation periods, revealing superpositions between individual vibrational levels within this state. Comparisons are made to previous studies of electronic wavepackets in atoms that highlight similarities to atomic behavior yet illustrate unique contributions of the diatomic molecular structure to the wavepacket, including the influence of different electronic potentials and vibrational-level-specific electronic dynamics.},

In this work, we explore and develop theoretical tools needed for interpretation of such spectra,in order to characterize the vibrational coherences that result from ionizing a molecule in a strong IR field. Ab initio data for F2 is combined with simulations of nuclear dynamics, in order to simulate time-resolved X-ray absorption spectra for vibrational wavepackets after coherent ionization at 0 K and at finite temperature. Dihalogens pose rather difficult electronic structure problems, and the issues encountered in this work will be reflective of those encountered with any core\textendash{}valence excitation simulation when a bond is breaking. The simulations reveal a strong dependence of the X-ray absorption maximum on the locations of the vibrational wave packets. A Fourier transform of the simulated signal shows features at the overtone frequencies of both the neutral and the cation, which reflect spatial interferences of the vibrational eigenstates. This provides a direct path for implementing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopic methods to visualize coherent nuclear dynamics.},

  abstract = {The dissociation dynamics of ferrocene are explored following strong field ionization using femtosecond time-resolved extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy. Employing transitions in the vicinity of the iron 3p (M2,3) edge, the dissociation is monitored from the point of view of the iron atom. With low strong field pump intensities ({$\approx$}2 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm-2), only ferrocenium cations are produced, and their iron 3p absorption spectrum is reported. It very closely resembles the 3p spectrum of atomic Fe+ ions but is red-shifted by 0.8 eV. With the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the spectrum is assigned to a combination of doublet and quartet spin states of ferrocenium ions. Ionization with more intense strong field pump pulses ({$\geq$}6 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm-2) leads predominantly to the prompt production of ferrocenium ions that dissociate to give the spectral signature of bare Fe+ ions within 240 {$\pm$} 80 fs. Within the temporal resolution of the experiment ({$\approx$}40 fs), no spectral intermediates are observed, suggesting that the dissociation process occurs directly from the excited ferrocenium ion and that the bonds between the iron center and both cyclopentadienyl rings are broken almost simultaneously in an asynchronous concerted decay process. No evidence of slower dissociation channels is observed at a pump-probe delay of 250 ps, suggesting that all energy is very rapidly routed into dissociative states.},

  abstract = {Nuclear and electronic dynamics in a wavepacket comprising bound Rydberg and valence electronic states of nitrogen from 12 to 15 eV are investigated using attosecond transient absorption. Vibrational quantum beats with a fundamental period of 50 femtoseconds persist for a picosecond in the b0 1R+u valence state. Multi-state calculations show that these coherences result primarily from near infraredinduced coupling between the inner and outer regions of the b0 1R+u state potential and the dark a00 1Rg+ state. The excellent spectral and temporal resolution of this technique allows measurement of the anharmonicity of the b0 1Ru+ potential directly from the observed quantum beats.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and table-top sources of x-rays based upon high harmonic generation (HHG) have revolutionized the field of ultrafast x-ray atomic and molecular physics, largely due to an explosive growth in capabilities in the past decade. XFELs now provide unprecedented intensity (1020 W cm-2) of x-rays at wavelengths down to {$\sim$}1 {\AA}ngstrom, and HHG provides unprecedented time resolution ({$\sim$}50 attoseconds) and a correspondingly large coherent bandwidth at longer wavelengths. For context, timescales can be referenced to the Bohr orbital period in hydrogen atom of 150 attoseconds and the hydrogen-molecule vibrational period of 8 femtoseconds; wavelength scales can be referenced to the chemically significant carbon K-edge at a photon energy of {$\sim$}280 eV (44 {\AA}ngstroms) and the bond length in methane of {$\sim$}1 {\AA}ngstrom. With these modern x-ray sources one now has the ability to focus on individual atoms, even when embedded in a complex molecule, and view electronic and nuclear motion on their intrinsic scales (attoseconds and {\AA}ngstroms). These sources have enabled coherent diffractive imaging, where one can image non-crystalline objects in three dimensions on ultrafast timescales, potentially with atomic resolution. The unprecedented intensity available with XFELs has opened new fields of multiphoton and nonlinear x-ray physics where behavior of matter under extreme conditions can be explored. The unprecedented time resolution and pulse synchronization provided by HHG sources has kindled fundamental investigations of time delays in photoionization, charge migration in molecules, and dynamics near conical intersections that are foundational to AMO physics and chemistry. This roadmap coincides with the year when three new XFEL facilities, operating at {\AA}ngstrom wavelengths, opened for users (European XFEL, Swiss-FEL and PAL-FEL in Korea) almost doubling the present worldwide number of XFELs, and documents the remarkable progress in HHG capabilities since its discovery roughly 30 years ago, showcasing experiments in AMO physics and other applications. Here we capture the perspectives of 17 leading groups and organize the contributions into four categories: ultrafast molecular dynamics, multidimensional x-ray spectroscopies; high-intensity x-ray phenomena; attosecond x-ray science.},

  abstract = {A metal-semiconductor heterojunction is investigated by Auger and photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the metallic film and to obtain the time-resolved electronic response induced by femtosecond laser excitation of the semiconductor material. The 3.5 monolayer (ML) Zn films deposited on p-type Si(100) at liquid nitrogen temperature grows in a layer-by-layer fashion. Electronic structure measurements by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the films are metallic in nature, creating a Schottky barrier at the 3.5 ML Zn/p-Si(100) interface. Utilizing a 35 fs, 800 nm pump pulse at a pump intensity of (2.5-6) \texttimes{} 109 W/cm2 to excite the Si and a time-delayed extreme ultraviolet pulse to probe the Zn, we observed large transient surface photovoltage shifts of 0.3-2.2 eV at carrier densities of (1.5-4.5) \texttimes{} 1020 cm-3. Three shifts are determined the Zn 3d core level, the photoemission onset, and the metallic Fermi level. The photovoltages increase with laser excitation intensity, and the Zn 3d core level exhibits the largest binding energy shifts due to pronounced screening of the core level. The large observed shifts are rationalized on the basis of the energetics of band flattening and carrier accumulation in the metallic layer of the Zn/p-Si(100) heterojunction at high carrier densities. The observed carrier recombination dynamics are biexponential in character, with similar time constants for both the Zn 3d and photoemission onset binding energy shifts. The Zn 3d core level shifts are also found to be sensitive to the electron temperature. These results show that core-level photoemission can be used to monitor valence electron dynamics, allowing separation of charge dynamics in heterojunctions and solids composed of multiple elements.},

  abstract = {Molecular triplet states constitute a crucial gateway in the photochemical reactions of organic molecules by serving as a reservoir for the excess electronic energy. Here, we report the remarkable sensitivity of soft X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy for following the intricate electronic structure changes accompanying the non-adiabatic transition of an excited molecule from the singlet to the triplet manifold. Core-level X-ray spectroscopy at the carbon-1s K-edge (284 eV) is applied to identify the role of the triplet state (T1, 3{$\pi\pi$}*) in the ultraviolet-induced photochemistry of pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone, AcAc). The excited-state dynamics initiated at 266 nm (1{$\pi\pi$}*, S2) is investigated with element- and sitespecificity using broadband soft X-ray pulses produced by high harmonic generation, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations of the X-ray spectra for the excited electronic singlet and triplet states. The evolution of the core-to-valence resonances at the carbon K-edge establishes an ultrafast population of the T1 state (3{$\pi\pi$}*) in AcAc via intersystem crossing on a 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 ps time scale.},

In this Perspective, we discuss some of the major achievements in the study of nuclear and electronic dynamics with X-ray pulses produced by high-harmonic, free-electron-laser and synchrotron sources. The particular dynamic processes probed by X-ray radiation highlighted in this Perspective are electronic coherences on attosecond to femtosecond timescales, chemical reactions, such as dissociations, and pericyclic ring-openings, spincrossover dynamics, ligand-exchange dynamics and structural deformations in excited states. X-ray spectroscopic probing of chemical dynamics holds great promise for the future owing to the ongoing developments of new spectroscopies, such as four-wave mixing, and the continuous improvements in emerging laboratory-based, high-harmonic sources and large-scale, facility-based, free-electron lasers.},

In this investigation, photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses, is used to investigate the electronic structure and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at a Si(100) surface decorated with Zn clusters. Static photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the changes in the electronic structure as the dimensionality of the Zn is increased from small clusters composed of a very few atoms to metallic Zn particles. Furthermore, femtosecond optical-pump XUV-probe photoemission spectroscopy is employed to induce a charge transfer from the p-Si(100) substrate to the Zn clusters and to measure in real time the charge trapping at the Zn cluster as well as the subsequent charge relaxation. The ultrafast charge carrier dynamics are also investigated for small clusters and metallic Zn particles. Significant transient charging of the Zn clusters after excitation of the Si(100) substrate by 800 nm light is observed for Zn coverages greater than 0.12 ML Zn, which coincides with the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the Zn particle and the p-Si(100) substrate. The transient signals show that the charge trapping time at the Zn cluster varies with the cluster size, which is rationalized based on the electronic structure of the cluster as well as the band energy alignment at the Zn cluster-Si(100) junction.},

Extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to measure small polaron formation rates and probabilities in goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) crystalline nanorods at pump photon energies from 2.2 to 3.1 eV. The measured polaron formation time increases with excitation photon energy from 70 {$\pm$} 10 fs at 2.2 eV to 350 {$\pm$} 30 fs at 2.6 eV, whereas the polaron formation probability (85 {$\pm$} 10\%) remains constant. By comparison to hematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3), an oxide analogue, the role of ligand composition and metal center density in small polaron formation time is discussed. This work suggests that incorporating small changes in ligands and crystal structure could enable the control of photoexcited small polaron formation in metal oxides.},

We develop attosecond XUV multidimensional spectroscopy here to separate interfering pathways on a near-infrared (NIR) energy axis, retrieving single state dynamics in argon atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) XUV-NIR spectrum. In this experiment, we measure four-wave mixing signal arising from the interaction of XUV attosecond pulses centered around 15 eV with two few-cycle NIR pulses. The 2D spectrum is created by measuring the emitted XUV signal field spectrum while applying narrowband amplitude and phase modulations to one of the NIR pulses. Application of such a technique to systems of high dimensionality will provide for the observation of state-resolved pure electronic dynamics, in direct analogy to phenomena unraveled by multidimensional spectroscopies at optical frequencies.},

  abstract = {Transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy probes core level transitions to unoccupied valence and conduction band states. Uncertainty remains as to what degree the core-hole created by the XUV transition modifies the measurement of photoexcited electron and hole energies. Here, the Si L2,3 edge is measured after photoexcitation of electrons to the {$\Delta$}, L, and {$\Gamma$} valleys of Si(100). The measured changes in the XUV transition probability do not energetically agree with the increasing electron photoexcitation energy. The data experimentally confirm that, for the Si L2,3 edge, the time-dependent electron and hole energies are partially obscured by the core-hole perturbation. A model based on many-body approximations and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is successfully used to predict the core-hole modification of the final transition density of states in terms of both electronic and structural dynamics. The resulting fit time constants match the excited-state electron thermalization time and the intervalley electron-phonon, intravalley electron-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering times previously measured in silicon. The outlined approach is a more comprehensive framework for interpreting transient XUV absorption spectra in photoexcited semiconductors.},

In this work, we systematically study single-shot, fs-laser ablation (fs-LIA) of single-crystal germanium from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, and compare the fs-LIA wavelength scaling with two widely used models. We show that these models are inadequate, particularly at mid-infrared wavelengths. Instead, a hybrid model is proposed involving Keldysh ionization rates, a constant free-carrier density threshold, and multi-band effects, which yields good agreement with experimental observations. Aspects of this model may be applied to understanding other strong-field non-perturbative phenomena in solids.},

It is found that the beam radius is equal to the modulus of X(z) and the on-axis phase to the phase of X(z). Using this representation, we derive a general expression for the on-axis phase shift {$\Delta\Phi$} experienced by a beam with an input complex beam parameter q through an optical system whose ray matrix is [ABCD]:{$\Delta\Phi$}=phase of(A+B/q). When the beam is matched to the optical system (output q = q), {$\Delta\Phi$} can be written cos\textendash{}1(A + D)/2.

In the region between 27 and 40 eV the observed structure is due to two types of electronic excitation: (i) the excitation of a single 3s electron, resulting in the configuration 3s3p6np and (ii) the excitation of two of the outer 3p electrons simultaneously, resulting in configurations of the type 3s23p4nln{${'}$}l{${'}$}. Between 44 and 59 eV, weak structures have been observed in the absorption continuum because of the simultaneous excitation of a 3s and a 3p electron, resulting in configurations of the type 3s3p5nln{${'}$}l{${'}$}. All of the observed resonances have been tabulated, and a partial classification has been given. The profiles of the resonances involving states 3s3p6np1P1{$\circ$}, for n=4, 5, and 6, and the two-electron excitation states 3s23p4(3P)4s(2P32)4p and 3s23p4(3P)3d(2P32)4p, have been studied quantitatively.

Here, the element-specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses is used to measure the charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO2-Si junction. After photoexcitation of silicon, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in \textasciitilde{}100 fs, resulting in spectral shifts in the Ni M2,3 XUV edge that are characteristic of holes and the absence of holes initially in TiO2. Meanwhile, the electrons are observed to remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO2, shifting the Ti spectrum to higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO2 interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO2 and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.},

  title = {Tunable {{Ultrafast Coherent Light}} in the {{Soft}} and {{Hard X}}-Ray {{Regions}} of the {{Spectrum}}: {{Phase Matching}} of {{Extreme High}}-{{Order Harmonic Generation}}},
  abstract = {Using the extreme nonlinear optical process of high harmonic generation, light from an ultrafast infrared laser can be coherently upconverted to generate fully co-herent and laser-like beams in the extreme ultraviolet region of the spectrum, with femtosecond-to-attosecond pulse duration. However, progress in extending extreme non-linear optical techniques into the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum has been hindered to-date, not by the inability of the high harmonic process to generate X-rays, but by the lack of techniques for phase matching this highly nonlinear process. This thesis reports on significant experimental and theoretical advances in two alternative approaches to obtain bright high harmonic emission at keV photon energies. First, using high harmonic generation from ions in a plasma waveguide, it was demonstrated that one can extend significantly the energy range of the generated photons by increasing the laser intensity. At high driving \textasciimacron{}elds, the plasma waveguide prevents laser defocusing, reduces ionization loses, allows to design the ion species independently from the laser dynamics, and provides more uniform propagation conditions amenable to apply quasi phase matching techniques. All-optical quasi phase matching techniques - high-order difference-frequency mixing and grating-assisted phase matching - are proposed in this scheme. Second, in a contrasting regime, using high harmonic generation from weakly-ionized neutral atoms in a hollow waveguide and by increasing the driving laser wavelength, it is shown for the first time that there is no maximum photon energy limit for perfect phase matching of the process. In the past decade prior to our demonstration, it was widely accepted that conventional phase matching of high harmonic generation is limited to about 100 eV. In analogy with the single-atom cuto\textregistered{}energy in a microscopic picture, we introduce the concept of a phase matching cuto\textregistered{}energy in a macroscopic picture. A simple phase-matching cuto\textregistered{} rule is obtained, describing the maximum photon energy that can be fully phase-matched as a function of the laser wavelength. We verify our scaling predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum (inside the water window of the spectrum), using ultrafast mid-IR driving laser pulses and extended, high pressure, weakly ionized gas medium. We also show through calculations that scaling of the overall conversion e{$\pm$}ciency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making tabletop, fully coherent, multi-keV X-ray sources feasible. The rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield, predicted for harmonics driven by longer-wavelength lasers, is compensated macroscopically by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated X-rays. In addition, this simple and experimentally attractive regime represents prospects to macroscopically isolate femtosecond-to-attosecond-to-zeptosecond x-ray pulses through phase matching gating. The perfect phase matching and quasi phase matching techniques presented here can provide either broadband or quasi-monochromatic, tunable, ultrafast light in the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum that can be used for applications in microscopy, nanoscience and nanotechnology, X-ray nonlinear optics, as well as wide range of fundamental studies of materials and molecular dynamics.},

Because HHG relies on a near infrared (NIR) driver pulse to create the XUV radiation, it is readily incorporated into pump-probe transient absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, giving way to measurements with unprecedented
temporal resolution. The ability of attosecond XUV pump-probe spectroscopy to study solid state semiconductor materials allows for the interrogation of carriers on the timescales where a separation between electronic and lattice dynamics can occur. This will have far reaching
implications addressing the fundamental carrier physics that govern the next generation of hot carrier charge transfer devices, which are at the forefront of photocatalytic and electronic device development.

In this dissertation, a literature review of XUV transient absorption on solids using HHG is presented in Chapter 1. This chapter details the progress from femtosecond experiments on metal-oxide thin  lms to attosecond time-resolved experiments on semiconductors. In Chapter 2, the design and construction of the attosecond transient absorption apparatus capable of studying ultrafast dynamics in both solid state and gas phase samples using a near infrared (NIR) pump and an extreme ultraviolet (XUV) probe is presented. Chapter 3 presents transient absorption experiments done on germanium thin  lms, which measure both electrons and hole dynamics simultaneously in a single measurement. These results are supported by work from a theory collaboration. in Chapter 4, preliminary work on silicon germanium alloys is presented. While the results need further con rmation by additional experiments and characterization, it is clear that signals from hot carrier relaxation are present. Chapter 5 presents a theoretical investigation of a future experiment on silver nanoparticles using a velocity map imaging (VMI) device. The key feature of this theoretical study is the identi cation of a metric to follow the near- eld of the plasmon, isolated from the electric  eld of the exciting laser pulse.},

Aim of the proposed configuration is to provide a micro-focused image through a high demagnification of the XUV source with the following characteristics: i) almost negligible aberrations; ii) long exit arm to easily accommodate at the output the experimental setups required for the applications of the focused attosecond pulses; iii) possibility to have an intermediate region where the XUV beam is collimated, in order to insert a plane split-mirror for the generation of two XUV pulse replicas to be used in a XUV-pump/XUV-probe setup. We present the analytical and numerical study of two optical configurations characterized by two sections based on the use of toroidal mirrors. The first section provides a demagnified image of the source in an intermediate focus that is free from defocusing but has a large coma aberration. The second section consists of a relay mirror that is mounted in Z-shaped geometry with respect to the previous one, in order to give a stigmatic image with a coma that is opposite to that provided by the first section. An example is provided to demonstrate the capability to achieve spot sizes in the 5-15 {$\mu$}m range with a demagnification higher than 10 in a compact envelope.},

Here we show with CO2 molecules that high harmonic interferometry can retrieve this structural and dynamic information: by measuring the phases and amplitudes of the harmonic emission, we reveal `fingerprints' of multiple molecular orbitals participating in the process and decode the underlying attosecond multi-electron dynamics, including the dynamics of electron rearrangement upon ionization. These findings establish high harmonic interferometry as an effective approach to resolving multi-electron dynamics with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"o}m spatial resolution arising from the de Broglie wavelength of the recombining electron, and attosecond temporal resolution arising from the timescale of the recombination event.},

  abstract = {The word `attosecond' (1 as = 10-18 s) officially entered the vocabulary of physics when sub-femtosecond pulses of UV/XUV light produced either by nonlinear frequency conversion of a ultra-short infrared pump pulse or Fourier synthesis of broad bandwidth radiation were established. The physics of these pulses is based on nonlinear, nonperturbative laser\textendash{}atom interaction: stimulated Raman scattering or high harmonic generation (HHG) is used to generate the necessary bandwidth, which naturally encompasses the visible and UV/XUV spectral range. However, the crucial element for attosecond pulse generation is the control of the spectral phase. New methods of temporal characterization at frequencies lying in the UV/XUV had to be elaborated. These methods rely on the energy/momentum analysis of photoelectrons produced by XUV attosecond flashes in the presence of an intense infrared field whose optical cycle itself becomes the basic clock. Single 650 as pulses have been produced and applied to trace the dynamics of electrons inside atoms following the creation of an inner-shell hole. Periodic combs of 250 as pulses have been synthesized by superposing just four harmonics and applying to the attosecond timing of the electron motion in HHG. Although it is easy to increase the bandwidth by coupling more harmonics, a fundamental limit to the duration of the light bursts produced has been discovered. It is imposed by the lack of synchronization of the different harmonic orders. The current limit is estimated to be 130 as. The latest advances include a direct autocorrelation of an attosecond pulse train and the production of a single 250 as soft x-ray pulse. This paper offers a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in the production and characterization of attosecond light pulses, with a glimpse at the first steps in attophysics.},

Numerous chemical processes begin with ionization: the ejection of an electron from a molecule. What happens in the immediate aftermath of that event? Kraus et al. explored this question in iodoacetylene by detecting and analyzing the spectrum of emitted high harmonics (see the Perspective by Ueda). They traced the migration of the residual positively charged hole along the molecular axis on a time scale faster than a quadrillionth of a second. They thereby characterized the capacity of a laser field to steer the hole's motion in appropriately oriented molecules.
Science, this issue p. 790; see also p. 740
The ultrafast motion of electrons and holes after light-matter interaction is fundamental to a broad range of chemical and biophysical processes. We advanced high-harmonic spectroscopy to resolve spatially and temporally the migration of an electron hole immediately after ionization of iodoacetylene while simultaneously demonstrating extensive control over the process. A multidimensional approach, based on the measurement and accurate theoretical description of both even and odd harmonic orders, enabled us to reconstruct both quantum amplitudes and phases of the electronic states with a resolution of \textasciitilde{}100 attoseconds. We separately reconstructed quasi\textendash{}field-free and laser-controlled charge migration as a function of the spatial orientation of the molecule and determined the shape of the hole created by ionization. Our technique opens the prospect of laser control over electronic primary processes.
High harmonics reveal fine details of electronic rearrangement in a molecule in the first instants after ionization. [Also see Perspective by Ueda]

The incoherent sum of the two components of the electric field is measured using a bi-dimensional transient grating while one of the components is simultaneously characterized using two-source interferometry.

For optical pulses the manipulation and characterization of the light polarization state is fundamental because of its relevance in several scientific and technological fields. In this work, we demonstrate the complete temporal reconstruction of the electric field of few-cycle pulses with a complex time-dependent polarization. Our experimental approach is based on extreme ultraviolet interferometry with isolated attosecond pulses and on the demonstration that the motion of an attosecond electron wave packet is sensitive to perturbing fields only along the direction of its motion. By exploiting the sensitivity of interferometric techniques and by controlling the emission and acceleration direction of the wave packet, pulses with energies as low as a few hundreds of nanojoules can be reconstructed. Our approach reveals the possibility to characterize completely the electric field of the pulses typically used in visible pump\textendash{}probe spectroscopy.},

The two bright foci produce two synchronized HHG sources. One of them is used to probe on-going dynamics in the generating medium, while the other serves to heterodyne the signal.

Both Fresnel diffraction calculations and an experimental lens position scan are used to reveal variations of the phase front inclination in each source.

  title = {Generation and {{Characterization}} of {{Isolated Attosecond Pulse}} in the {{Soft X}}-{{RAY Regime}}.....},
  abstract = {The observation of any atomic and molecular dynamics requires a probe that has a timescale comparable to the dynamics itself. Ever since the invention of laser, the temporal
duration of the laser pulse has been incrementally reduced from several nanoseconds to just attoseconds. Picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses have been widely used to study molecular rotation and vibration.
In 2001, the first single isolated attosecond pulse (1 attosecond = 10-18 seconds.) was demonstrated. Since this breakthrough, ``attoscience'' has become a hot topic in ultrafast physics. Attosecond pulses typically have span between EUV to X-ray photon energies and subfemtosecond pulse duration. It becomes an ideal tool for experimentalists to study ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and condensed matter.
The conventional scheme for generating attosecond pulses is focusing an intense femtosecond laser pulse into inert gases. The bound electrons are ionized into continuum through tunneling ionization under the strong electrical field. After ionization, the free electron will be accelerated by the laser field away from the parent ion and then recombined with its parent ion and releases its kinetic energy as a photon burst that lasts for a few hundred attoseconds. According to the classical ``three-step model'', high order harmonic will have a higher cutoff photon energy when driven by a longer wavelength laser field. Compared to Ti:sapphire lasers center at a wavelength of 800 nm, an optical parametric amplifier could offer a broad bandwidth at infrared range, which could support few cycle pulses for driving high harmonic generation in the X-ray spectrum range.
In this work, an optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification system was developed to deliver CEP-stable 3-mJ, 12-fs pulses centered at 1.7 micron. We implement a chirped-pump technique to phase match the board parametric amplification bandwidth with high conversion efficiency. Using such a laser source, isolated attosecond pulses with photon exceeding 300 eV are achieved by applying the polarization gating technique at 1.7 micron. The intrinsic positive chirp of the attosecond pulses is measured by the attosecond streak camera and retrieved with our PROOF technique. Sn metal filters with negative dispersion were chosen to compensate the intrinsic attochirp. As a result, isolated 53-attosecond soft x-ray pulses are achieved. Such water window attosecond source will be a powerful tool for studying charge distribution/migration in bio-molecules and will bring opportunities to study high field physics or attochemistry.},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental goals of attosecond science is to observe and to control the dynamic evolutions of electrons in matter. The attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is a powerful tool to utilize attosecond pulse to measure electron dynamics in quantum systems directly. In this work, isolated single attosecond pulses are used to probe electron dynamics in atoms and to study dynamics in hydrogen molecules using the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy technique. The target atom/molecule is first pumped to excited states and then probed by a subsequent attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse or by a near infrared (NIR) laser pulse. By measuring the absorbed attosecond XUV pulse spectrum, the ultrafast electron correlation dynamics can be studied in real time. The quantum processes that can be studied using the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy include the AC stark shift, multi-photon absorption, intermediate states of atoms, autoionizing states, and transitions of vibrational states in molecules. In all experiments, the absorption changes as a function of the time delay between the attosecond XUV probe pulse and the dressing NIR laser pulse, on a time scale of sub-cycle laser period, which reveals attosecond electron dynamics. These experiments demonstrate that the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy can be performed to study and control electronic and nuclear dynamics in quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution, and it opens door for the study of electron dynamics in large molecules and other more complex systems.},

  title = {Towards {{High}}-{{Flux Isolated Attosecond Pulses}} with a 200 {{TW CPA}}},
  abstract = {Attosecond pulses have been developed as a means for investigating phenomena that proceed on the order of the atomic unit of time (24 as). Unfortunately, these extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses by themselves contain too few photons to initiate nonlinear dynamics or dress states in an attosecond
pump\textendash{}attosecond probe scheme. As a result, most attosecond experiments thus far have featured complementary near infrared (NIR) femtosecond lasers for instigating electron dynamics. In order to access the benefits of all-attosecond measurements and open attosecond physics to new fields of
exploration, the photon flux of these pulses must be increased.

One way to boost the attosecond pulse energy is to scale up the energy of the NIR pulse responsible for driving high-harmonic generation (HHG). With generalized double optical gating (GDOG), isolated attosecond pulses can be generated with multi-cycle laser systems, wherein the pulse energy can be boosted more easily than in the few-cycle laser systems required by other gating methods. At the Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (IFAST), this scalability was demonstrated using a 350 mJ, 15 fs (10 TW) Ti:sapphire laser, which was used to generate a 100 nJ XUV continuum. This represented an order-of-magnitude improvement over typical attosecond pulse energies achievable by millijoule-level few-cycle lasers.

To obtain the microjoule-level attosecond pulse energy required for performing all-attosecond experiments, the attosecond flux generated by the IFAST 10 TW system was still deficient by an order of magnitude. To this end, the laser system was upgraded to provide joule-level output energies while maintaining pulse compression to 15 fs, with a targeted peak power of 200 TW. This was accomplished by adding an additional Ti:sapphire amplifier to the existing 10 TW system and implementing a new pulse compression system to accommodate the higher pulse energy.

Because this system operated at a 10 Hz repetition rate, stabilization of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) \textendash{} important for controlling attosecond pulse production \textendash{} could not be achieved using traditional methods. Therefore, a new scheme was developed, demonstrating the first-ever control of
CEP in a chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA) at low repetition rates.

Finally, a new variation of optical gating was proposed as a way to improve the efficiency of the attosecond pulse generation process. This method was also predicted to allow for the generation of isolated attosecond pulses with longer driving laser pulses, as well as the extension of the highenergy photon cut-off of the XUV continuum.},

  abstract = {Dynamics occurring on microscopic scales, such as electronic motion inside atoms and molecules, are governed by quantum mechanics. However, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is usually too complicated to solve analytically for systems other than the hydrogen atom. Even for some simple atoms such as helium, it still takes months to do a full numerical analysis. Therefore, practical problems are often solved only after simplification. The results are then compared with the experimental outcome in both the spectral and temporal domain. For accurate experimental comparison, temporal resolution on the attosecond scale is required. This had not been achieved until the first demonstration of the single attosecond pulse in 2001. After this breakthrough, ``attophysics'' immediately became a hot field in the physics and optics community. 

While the attosecond pulse has served as an irreplaceable tool in many fundamental research studies of ultrafast dynamics, the pulse generation process itself is an interesting topic in the ultrafast field. When an intense femtosecond laser is tightly focused on a gaseous target, electrons inside the neutral atoms are ripped away through tunneling ionization. Under certain circumstances, the electrons are able to reunite with the parent ions and release photon bursts lasting only tens to hundreds of attoseconds. This process repeats itself every half cycle of the driving pulse, generating a train of single attosecond pulses which lasts longer than one femtosecond. To achieve true temporal resolution on the attosecond time scale, single isolated attosecond pulses are required, meaning only one attosecond pulse can be produced per driving pulse.

Up to now, there are only a few methods which have been demonstrated experimentally to generate isolated attosecond pulses. Pioneering work generated single attosecond pulse using a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized 3.3 fs laser pulse, which is out of reach for most research groups. An alternative method termed as polarization gating generated single attosecond pulses with 5 fs driving pulses, which is still difficult to achieve experimentally. Most recently, a new technique termed as Double Optical Gating (DOG) was developed in our group to allow the generation of single attosecond pulse with longer driving pulse durations. For example, isolated 150 as pulses were demonstrated with a 25 fs driving laser directly from a commerciallyavailable Ti:Sapphire amplifier. Isolated attosecond pulses as short as 107 as have been demonstrated with the DOG scheme before this work. Here, we employ this method to shorten the pulse duration even further, demonstrating world-record isolated 67 as pulses. 

Optical pulses with attosecond duration are the shortest controllable process up to now and are much faster than the electron response times in any electronic devices. In consequence, it is also a challenge to characterize attosecond pulses experimentally, especially when they feature a broadband spectrum. Similar challenges have previously been met in characterizing femtosecond laser pulses, with many schemes already proposed and well-demonstrated experimentally. Similar schemes can be applied in characterizing attosecond pulses with narrow bandwidth. The limitation of these techniques is presented here, and a method recently developed to overcome those limitations is discussed.

At last, several experimental advances toward the characterization of the isolated 25 as pulses, which is one atomic unit time, are discussed briefly.},

First, a unique Ti:Sapphire chirped pulse amplifier laser system that delivers 14 fs pulses with 300 mJ energy at a 10 Hz repetition rate was designed and built. The broadband spectrum extending from 700 nm to 900 nm was obtained by seeding a two stage Ti:Sapphire chirped pulse power amplifier with mJ-level white light pulses from a gas filled hollow core fiber. It is the highest energy level ever achieved by a broadband pulse in a chirped pulse amplifier up to the current date.

Detailed gate width analysis of the ellipticity dependent pulse were performed. Calculation of electron light interaction dynamics on the atomic level was carried out to demonstrate the mechanism of isolated pulse generation. Third, a complete diagnostic apparatus was built to extract and analyze the generated attosecond pulse in spectral domain. The result confirms that an extreme ultraviolet super continuum supporting 230 as isolated attosecond pulses at 35 eV was generated using the generalized double optical gating technique.

  abstract = {Tracking and controlling the dynamic evolution of matter under the influence of external fields is among the most fundamental goals of physics. In the microcosm, the motion of electrons follows the laws of quantum mechanics and evolves on the timescale set by the atomic unit of time, 24 attoseconds. While only a few time-dependent quantum mechanical systems can be solved theoretically, recent advances in the generation, characterization, and application of isolated attosecond pulses and few-cycle femtosecond lasers have given experimentalists the necessary tools for dynamic measurements on these systems. However, pioneering studies in attosecond science have so far been limited to the measurement of free electron dynamics, which can in most cases be described approximately using classical mechanics. Novel tools and techniques for studying bound states of matter are therefore desired to test the available theoretical models and to enrich our understanding of the quantum world on as-yet unprecedented timescales.

In this work, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with ultrabroadband attosecond pulses is presented as a technique for direct measurement of electron dynamics in quantum systems, demonstrating for the first time that the attosecond transient absorption technique allows for state-resolved and simultaneous measurement of bound and continuum state dynamics. The helium atom is the primary target of the presented studies, owing to its accessibility to theoretical modeling with both ab initio simulations and to model systems with reduced dimensionality. In these studies, ultrafast dynamics \textendash{} on timescales shorter than the laser cycle \textendash{} are observed in prototypical quantum mechanical processes such as the AC Stark and ponderomotive energy level shifts, Rabi oscillations and electromagnetically-induced absorption and transparency, and two-color multi-photon absorption to ``dark'' states of the atom. These features are observed in both bound states and quasi-bound autoionizing states of the atom.

Furthermore, dynamic interference oscillations, corresponding to quantum path interferences involving bound and free electronic states of the atom, are observed for the first time in an optical measurement. These first experiments demonstrate the applicability of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with ultrabroadband attosecond pulses to the study and control of electron dynamics in quantum mechanical systems with high fidelity and state selectivity. The technique is therefore ideally suited for the study of charge transfer and collective electron motion in more complex systems. The transient absorption studies on atomic bound states require ultrabroadband attosecond pulses - attosecond pulses with large spectral bandwidth compared to their central frequency. This is due to the fact that the bound states in which we are interested lie only 15-25 eV above the ground state, so the central frequency of the pulse should lie in this range. On the other hand, the bandwidth needed to generate an isolated 100 as pulse exceeds 18 eV \textendash{} comparable to or even larger than the central frequency. However, current methods for characterizing attosecond pulses require that the attosecond pulse spectrum bandwidth is small compared to its central frequency, known as the central momentum approximation. We therefore explore the limits of attosecond pulse characterization using the current technology and propose a novel method for characterizing ultrabroadband attosecond pules, which we term PROOF (phase retrieval by omega oscillation filtering). We demonstrate the PROOF technique with both simulated and experimental data, culminating in the characterization of a world-record-breaking 67 as pulse.},

  abstract = {Extremely broad bandwidth attosecond pulses (which can support 16as pulses) have been demonstrated in our lab based on spectral measurements, however, compensation of intrinsic chirp and their characterization has been a major bottleneck. In this work, we developed an attosecond streak camera using a multi-layer Mo/Si mirror (bandwidth can support \textasciitilde{}100as pulses) and position sensitive time-of-flight detector, and the shortest measured pulse was 107.5as using DOG, which is close to the mirror bandwidth. We also developed a PCGPA based FROG-CRAB algorithm to characterize such short pulses, however, it uses the central momentum approximation and cannot be used for ultra-broad bandwidth pulses. To facilitate the characterization of such pulses, we developed PROOF using Fourier filtering and an evolutionary algorithm. We have demonstrated the characterization of pulses with a bandwidth
corresponding to \textasciitilde{}20as using synthetic data. We also for the first time demonstrated single attosecond pulses (SAP) generated using GDOG with a narrow gate width from a multi-cycle driving laser without CE-phase lock, which opens the possibility of scaling attosecond photon flux by extending the technique to peta-watt class lasers.

Further, we generated intense attosecond pulse trains (APT) from laser ablated carbon plasmas and demonstrated \textasciitilde{}9.5 times more intense pulses as compared to those from argon gas and for the first time demonstrated a broad continuum from a carbon plasma using DOG.

Additionally, we demonstrated \textasciitilde{}100 times enhancement in APT from gases by switching to 400 nm (blue) driving pulses instead of 800 nm (red) pulses. We measured the ellipticity dependence of high harmonics from blue pulses in argon, neon and helium, and developed a simple theoretical model to numerically calculate the ellipticity dependence with good agreement with experiments. Based on the ellipticity dependence, we proposed a new scheme of blue GDOG which we predict can be employed to extract intense SAP from an APT driven by blue laser pulses. We also demonstrated compression of long blue pulses into {$>$}240 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}J broad bandwidth pulses using neon filled hollow core fiber, which is the highest reported pulse energy of short blue pulses. However, compression of phase using chirp mirrors is still a technical challenge.},

When the delay between a few-cycle NIR pulse and a single attosecond XUV pulse is scanned, the Fano resonance shapes of the argon autoionizing states are modified by the NIR pulse, which shows the direct observation and control of electron-electron correlation in the temporal domain.},

The first known measurement of the dipole phase jump at a Cooper minimum is reported for the 3p orbital of argon. Also, the angle-dependent dipole of nitrogen is measured using rotationally-aligned molecular ensembles. In contrast with previous studies, which were limited by traditional shorter-wavelength near-infrared laser sources, only a single orbital is sufficient to explain the nitrogen results, which are in excellent agreement with accurate theoretical scattering-wave dipole calculations. All of these experiments benefit from the extended extreme-ultraviolet cutoff, and improved spectral resolution, afforded by the use of long-wavelength mid-infrared driving laser sources.

This work extends our understanding of the interaction of light and matter on the timescale of the electron's motion, the attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s). The experimental results presented here lend credence to the methodology of molecular self-imaging by laser induced ionization and recombination of a molecule's own electron. The successes and limitations of HHS as a tool for ultrafast atomic and molecular imaging are discussed.

In this dissertation, a visible-pump/XUV-probe transient absorption apparatus with femtosecond resolution was constructed to investigate the carrier relaxation dynamics in semiconductors after photo-excitation. This includes timescales for carrier thermalization by carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering. The 30 \textendash{} 72 eV photon energy coverage (17 \textendash{} 40 nm wavelength) generated by a table-top XUV light source is suitable for probing the 3p-to-3d core level absorptions of various transition metal oxides (TMOs) with specificities to elements and oxidation states.

In Chapter 1, a brief introduction to charge carrier dynamics in semiconductor-based materials is given. In addition, fundamentals of core-level spectroscopy and the high harmonic generation (HHG) process are also addressed in this introductory chapter. Specifications of the experimental apparatus that was constructed are summarized in Chapter 2, including the design concepts and characterization of performance. Chapter 3 presents the spectral tunability of the XUV pulses generated from a semi-infinite gas cell (SIGC), as well as the data acquisition procedures. Charge carrier relaxation dynamics in Co3O4 following the charge transfer excitation pathway at 400 nm are documented in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, various visible pump wavelengths are used to excite Co3O4 and the differences in the carrier dynamics versus excitation wavelength are considered. After selectively photoexciting a Si/TiO2 heterojunction, the resulted electron transfer process is observed and reported in Chapter 6.

The objective of this dissertation work was the construction of an attosecond beamline at The Ohio State University, and the implementation of the so-called Rabbitt technique. This apparatus is the second of its kind in the United States.

The Rabbitt experiment is a pump-probe interferometer that leads to the characterization of the temporal structure of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) and soft X ray harmonics, generated using intense IR (infrared) lasers. This allows us to find the optimal conditions for generating attosecond pulses. The attosecond pulses can then be used in the same apparatus to study the dynamics of atomic processes on the attosecond timescale and for molecular imaging. The novelty of this setup is the use of long wavelength ({$>$} 1{$\mu$}m) laser beams, which will generate much shorter attosecond pulses than reported so far in literature and with a central energy that can be chosen to be much higher.

One of the results of the experiment is the determination of the attochirp (i.e. the second order derivative of the harmonics' phase with respect to their frequency) scaling with the fundamental laser wavelength. The attochirp is found to have a dependence on the atomic species used to generate the harmonics. The attochirp also significantly depends on the position of the generating gas source relative to the laser focus, the pressure of the generating gas and the IR laser intensity. The influence of inner subshell electrons and the fine structure of the detection gas, secondary electrons, as well as Fano resonances in the detection gas are discussed.},

In order to scale up the attosecond flux, a unique Ti:-Sapphire laser system with a three-stage amplifier that delivers pulses with a 2 J energy at a 10 Hz repetition rate was designed and built. The broadband pulse spectrum covering from 700 nm to 900 nm was generated, supporting a pulse duration of 12 fs. The high flux high-order harmonics were generated in a gas tube filled with argon by a loosely focused geometry under a phasematching condition. The wavefront distortions for the driving laser were corrected by a deformable mirror with a Shack-Hartmann sensor to significantly improve the extreme ultraviolet radiation conversion efficiency due to the excellent beam profile at focus. A high-damage-threshold beam splitter is demonstrated to eliminate energetic driving laser pulses from high-order harmonics. The extreme ultraviolet pulse energy is measured to be 0.3 microjoule at the exit of the argon gas target. The experimental facilities developed will lead to the generation of microjoule level isolated attosecond pulses and the demonstration of true atto pump-atto probe experiments in near future.

  abstract = {We show how bright, tabletop, fully coherent hard X-ray beams can be generated through nonlinear upconversion of femtosecond laser light. By driving the high-order harmonic generation process using longer-wavelength midinfrared light, we show that, in theory, fully phase-matched frequency upconversion can extend into the hard X-ray region of the spectrum. We verify our scaling predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV, using ultrafast driving laser pulses at 1.3-{$\mu$}m wavelength, in an extended, high-pressure, weakly ionized gas medium. We also show through calculations that scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making tabletop, fully coherent, multi-keV X-ray sources feasible. The rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield, predicted for harmonics driven by longer-wavelength lasers, is compensated macroscopically by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated X-rays.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

Photodissociation of CH2IBr along both the C\textendash{}I or C\textendash{}Br reaction coordinates is observed in real-time following excitation at 266 nm. At this wavelength, C\textendash{}I dissociation is the dominant reaction channel and C\textendash{}Br dissociation is observed as a minor pathway. Both photodissociation pathways are probed simultaneously through individual 4d(I) N4/5 and 3d(Br) M4/5 core-to-valence transitions. The 3d(Br) M4/5 pre-edge absorption spectrum of the CH2Br radical photoproduct corresponding to the C\textendash{}I dissociation channel is characterized for the first time. Although the radical's singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is mostly localized on the central carbon atom, the 3d(Br)\textrightarrow{$\pi$} {${_\ast}$}(SOMO) resonances at 68.5 eV and 69.5 eV are detected 2 eV below the parent molecule 3d(Br)\textrightarrow{$\sigma$} {${_\ast}$}(LUMO) transitions. Core-to-valence XUV absorption spectroscopy provides a unique probe of the local electronic structure of the radical species in reference to the Br reporter atom. The measured times for C\textendash{}I dissociation leading to I and I{${_\ast}$} atomic products are 48 {$\pm$} 12 fs and 44 {$\pm$} 4 fs, respectively, while the measured C\textendash{}Br dissociation time leading to atomic Br is 114 {$\pm$} 17 fs.

High-order harmonics were generated by loosely focusing a high-energy laser pulse centered around 800 nm into a gas cell filled with argon in a phase-matching condition. The wavefront distortions of the driving pulse were corrected by a deformable mirror, and the XUV conversion efficiency was significantly improved due to the excellent beam profile at focus. A high-damage-threshold beam splitter was used to eliminate high-energy driving pulses copropagating with high-order harmonics. The setup has a potential to provide intense ultrashort XUV pulses reaching the intensity levels required for nonlinear experiments in the XUV spectral range.},

The case where the strong pulse comes later is more favourable in terms of generating a higher cut-off and a shorter pulse duration.

Unlike synchrotron and free-electron sources, which suffer from relatively long pulse width or large time jitter, soft x-ray sources from HHG could offer attosecond time resolution and be synchronized with their driving field to investigate time-resolved near edge absorption spectroscopy, which could reveal rich structural and dynamical information of the interrogated samples. In this paper, we review recent progresses on generating and characterizing attosecond light sources in the water window region. We show our development of an energetic, two-cycle, carrier-envelope phase stable laser source at 1.7 {$\mu$}m and our achievement in producing a 53 as soft x-ray pulse covering the carbon K-edge in the water window. Such source paves the ways for the next generation x-ray spectroscopy with unprecedented temporal resolution.},

They investigate the influence of the laser pulse width, the excitation wavelength (from the near infrared to the ultraviolet) and the atomic medium on the number of photons produced and on the maximum energy attained. Harmonic generation also depends strongly on the focusing conditions. By using simple arguments and results of numerical calculations in xenon, they show that the conversion efficiency in general follows a simple b3 power law, b denoting the laser confocal parameter, up to a transition regime where the coherence length of the process becomes equal to the medium length. By applying the b3 scaling as a normalization factor, they can then compare experimental results obtained in different focusing geometries. Their experimental data show that the optimization of the photon energy produced is favoured by using long incident wavelengths and light atomic systems with a high ionization energy.},

The experimental conditions explored by Seres et al. indeed correspond to the case of long-pulse, low-infrared-energy laser beams for which tight focusing is necessary to reach the minimum intensity required for high atomic response. The positive atomic dispersion can compensate for the Gouy phase and explains the behavior of the experimental variation of the harmonic signal presented.

So far the conversion efficiencies that have been achieved in this regime are orders of magnitude behind the values that have been demonstrated with loose focusing of high energy (high peak power) lasers. In this contribution, we discuss the scaling laws for the main physical quantities of HHG and in particular analyze the limiting effects: dephasing, absorption and plasma defocusing. It turns out that phase-matched and absorption-limited HHG can be achieved even for very small focal spot sizes using a target gas provided with an adequately high density. Experimentally, we investigate HHG in a gas jet of argon, krypton and xenon. By analyzing the pressure dependence we are able to disentangle the dephasing and absorption effects and prove that the generated high order harmonics are phase-matched and absorption-limited. The obtained conversion efficiency is as high as 8 \texttimes{} 10-6 for the 17th harmonic generated in xenon and 1.4 \texttimes{} 10-6 for the 27th harmonic generated in argon. Our findings pave the way for highly efficient harmonic generation at megahertz repetition rates.},

In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of mag-nitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave.

  abstract = {Ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing electronic structure and charge carrier dynamics in catalytic materials because of its elemental, oxidation, coordination, and electronic spin-state sensitivity. To extend the benefits of this technique to investigating charge carrier dynamics at surfaces, we have developed near grazing-angle XUV reflection\textendash{}absorption (RA) spectroscopy. Because RA spectra probe both the real (i.e., reflection) and the imaginary (i.e., attenuation) parts of the refractive index, a general method is required to analyze RA spectra. Using semiempirical calculations, we demonstrate that XUV RA spectra of first row transition metal oxides retain the element and chemical state specificity of XUV absorption spectroscopy. We find that the imaginary part of the refractive index reports on the chemical state of the metal center, while the real part is additionally sensitive to the surface morphology of the material.},

  abstract = {When light hits a multilayer planar stack, it is reflected, refracted, and absorbed in a way that can be derived from the Fresnel equations. The analysis is treated in many textbooks, and implemented in many software programs, but certain aspects of it are difficult to find explicitly and consistently worked out in the literature. Here, we derive the formulas underlying the transfer-matrix method of calculating the optical properties of these stacks, including oblique-angle incidence, absorption-vs-position profiles, and ellipsometry parameters. We discuss and explain some strange consequences of the formulas in the situation where the incident and/or final (semi-infinite) medium are absorptive, such as calculating \$T{$>$}1\$ in the absence of gain. We also discuss some implementation details like complex-plane branch cuts. Finally, we derive modified formulas for including one or more "incoherent" layers, i.e. very thick layers in which interference can be neglected. This document was written in conjunction with the "tmm" Python software package, which implements these calculations.},
