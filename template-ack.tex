steve hageman - most work in this thesis was done in close collaboration with steve. major components of beamline were designed solely by steve, and he was there to help in nearly every single experiment. endless discussions on nearly every aspect of all experimental and design work.

andrew piper - OMRON safety system. attempt at interferometric stabilization

dietrich keissewetter - wrote the motor software, beamline pointing software out of the spitfire. helped with the initial design of the TABLe apparatus. helped chase down vibrations and make subtle improvements to the TABLe.

kent talbert - wrote the andor labview software, interfaced with the motors.

sierra o'bryan - optical design of the photon spectrometer

antoine camper - phase plate stuff.

tim gorman - endless discussions about physics, experimental design, laser 
troubleshooting

eric moore - laser pointing system.

pete at the machine shop - general machining help.

michael graham - mike helped with the design of the cage and crank, and had very useful tips and input for designing most mechanical systems.

jon the welder - he welded the spectrometer and mirror chambers, made modifications to the generation chamber, welded the high pressure cell input line.

Lou DiMauro - of course
