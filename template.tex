% template.tex - version 0.9.1.1 (5/26/2011)
%
% This is a template file for the osudiss-2 class. See
% osudiss-2.pdf for documentation, and the GS material 
% for the requirements.
%
% Copy the following osudiss-2 files your latex path (or just the folder containing this file):
% osudiss-2.cls (v0.9.1)
% sa-draftwater.sty
%
% Then, to compile this file:
% latex template
% bibtex template
% latex template
% latex template
%
% (You can also use pdflatex if you prefer.)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[11pt, onehalf, phd]{osudiss-2}
% The `11pt' option is unnecessary since it is the default

% `onehalf' sets the line spacing to one-and-a-half spacing instead of
% double spacing. 'double' sets the line spacing to double.

% The `phd' option is unnecessary since it is the default

% Remove `draft' option for final draft

% Below is an example of customizing the style of headings in your
% dissertation. See osudiss-2.pdf for more information.
%
% For example, if you simply must have uppercase titles:
%\renewcommand\typesetLevelOne[1]{{\Large\textbf{\MakeUppercase{#1}}\par}}
%\renewcommand\typesetLevelTwo[1]{{\Large\textbf{\MakeUppercase{#1}}}}
% Note the \par for \typesetLevelOne
%
% If you want the title to be bold and |\Large| instead of |\Huge|:
%\renewcommand\titleFont{\normalfont\Large\bfseries}

% Add words that TeX may not know how to hyphenate below. This can
% help prevent overfull hboxes. For example,
\hyphenation{eigen-state space-time}
